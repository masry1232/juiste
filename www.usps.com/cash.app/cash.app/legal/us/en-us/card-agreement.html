See the paragraph labeled “Adding Funds to your Card Account” for instructions on how to fund your Card Account for making transactions. You may not use your virtual Card for making purchases at any vending machines, kiosks or gas station pumps. Each time you use your physical Card or your virtual Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. The new balance will be available for making purchases with your physical and virtual Cards.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You are not allowed to exceed the amount of available funds in your Cash App through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. If you do not have enough funds available in your Cash App to fund your Card Account, you can instruct the merchant to charge a part of the purchase to the Card and pay the remaining amount using another payment method. These are called “split transactions.” Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the amount of available funds in your Cash App, you will be fully liable to us for the full amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. When making purchases with your Card at any point-of-sale (&quot;POS&quot;) device other than through a Digital Wallet provider, you may select “CREDIT” on the keypad to make a signature purchase. You may not use your Card for online gambling or illegal transactions. We may temporarily “freeze” or entirely deactivate your Card Account and attempt to contact you if we notice transactions that are unusual or appear suspicious.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Merchant Holds on Available Funds.</strong> When you use your Card or Card number to initiate a transaction at certain merchant locations, websites or mobile applications, such as hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and rental car companies, where the final purchase amount is unknown at the time of authorization, a hold may be placed on the available funds in your Card Account for an amount equal to or in excess of the final transaction amount. The funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for any other purpose until the merchant sends us the final transaction amount. Once we receive the final transaction amount, it may take up to seven days for the hold to be removed. During that period, you will not have access to the funds subject to the hold.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Cash Access.</strong> With your PIN, you may use your Card to obtain cash at ATMs that display the Visa marks or at any point-of-sale (POS) devices that bear the Visa marks as permitted by the merchant and subject to your available Card Account balance, the cash access transaction limits described below, and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn is $1,000.00 per transaction, $1,000.00 per day, and $1,000.00 per week. For security purposes, we may, in our sole discretion, limit your use of your Card at ATMs or POS devices. In addition, ATM owners and operators and networks may impose additional limits and surcharges on cash access transactions, including a fee for a balance inquiry even if you do not complete a fund transfer. Read the ATM screen message carefully for information related to surcharges before you complete a transaction at an ATM.</p></div></div></div><div id="toc-adding-funds-to-your-card-account" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>19.

You may not add funds to your Card Account by any other method, including credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts, cash or by sending personal checks, cashier’s checks, retailer load networks (e.g. GreenDot, MoneyGram, Western Union, etc.), or money orders to the Bank. The Bank will return all checks and money orders unless your Card Account has a negative balance, in which case the Bank may, in its sole discretion, apply the proceeds of the check or money order towards the negative balance of your Card Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you make direct deposits to your Cash App account by sending funds to the Bank through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system or other means, those funds will not be added to your Card Account balance and will not be held at the Bank.

Card Account Balance and FDIC Insurance.</strong> You are responsible for keeping track of your Cash App available balance for adding funds to your Card. Merchants generally will not be able to determine your available balance. It is important to know the amount of available funds in your Cash App for adding funds to your Card Account before performing a transaction. If you do not have sufficient available funds in your Cash App for adding funds to your Card Account to cover the transaction amount, the transaction will be declined. You acknowledge and agree that the funds available to perform transactions are limited to the funds that have been added to your Card Account from your Cash App that are not subject to a hold. You are not authorized to use funds added to your Card Account in error. Any transaction that could create a negative balance for your Card Account is not permitted. Adjustments may be made to your Card Account to reverse an error, reflect a merchant adjustment, or resolve a dispute regarding a transaction posted to your Card Account. These processing and adjustment entries could cause your Card Account to have a negative balance. If your Card Account has a negative balance, you agree: (a) that we may automatically apply any subsequent deposits to your Card Account to satisfy the negative balance and (b) to pay us on demand by a personal check, money order, or other payment method authorized by us for the amount of the negative balance.

Contacting the Company by telephone at 1-800-969-1940 is the best way to minimize possible losses. (a) Transaction Routed Through the Visa System. Visa Zero Liability Protection. Under Visa U.S.A. Inc. Operating Regulations. Your liability for unauthorized transactions using your Card Account that take place on the Visa system without a personal identification number (PIN) is $0.00 if you are not grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your Card. This reduced liability does not apply to PIN transactions not processed by Visa (see Transactions Not Routed Through the Visa System below). (b) Transaction Not Routed Through the Visa System. Unauthorized transactions that are not routed through Visa are not protected by the Visa Zero Liability Protection policy. These types of transactions include point of sale, PIN, PINless or other debit transactions not processed by Visa. If you tell us within two business days after you learn of any unauthorized transactions or the loss of your PIN, you will lose no more than $50 if someone accessed your Card Account without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within two business days after you learn of an unauthorized transaction or the loss of your PIN, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from accessing your Card Account without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your Card Account transaction history or other information shows transfers that you did not make or authorize, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the information is made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise required by applicable law, we, our affiliates, and the parties with whom we contract in order to offer the Cards, the Card Accounts, and related services are neither responsible nor liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of or relating in any way to the Cards, the Card Accounts, any products or services purchased using Card Accounts, or this Agreement (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us).</p></div></div></div><div id="toc-dispute-resolution-by-binding-arbitration-jury-trial-waiver-class-action-waiver" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>47. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Cards, the Card Accounts, or this Agreement (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean the Bank and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, “we” and “us” includes the Company and any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Cards, the Card Accounts, or this Agreement (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving contract disputes. As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in your state or municipality within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the paragraph labelled “Limitation of Liability,” the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law. This Section will survive termination of your Card Account or this Agreement as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence. You may reject this Arbitration provision by sending a written rejection notice to us at: Block, Inc., <!-- -->Attn: Arbitration Agreement, 1955 Broadway, Suite 600, Oakland, 94612.<!-- --> Your rejection notice must be mailed within 45 days after your first card purchase. Your rejection notice must state that you reject the Arbitration provision and include your name, address, phone number, and email associated with your Account; Account number; and personal signature. No one else may sign the rejection notice. If your rejection notice complies with these requirements, this Arbitration provision and any other arbitration provisions in the cardmember agreements for any other currently open Cash App Card accounts you have will not apply to you, except for any claims subject to pending litigation or arbitration at the time you send your rejection notice. Rejection of this Arbitration provision will not affect your other rights or responsibilities under this section or the Agreement.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">For more information on the AAA, the Rules and Procedures, or the process for filing an arbitration claim, you may visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.</p></div></div></div><div id="misc" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>46.

Contacting the Company by telephone at 1-800-969-1940 is the best way to minimize possible losses. (a) Transaction Routed Through the Visa System. Visa Zero Liability Protection. Under Visa U.S.A. Inc. Operating Regulations. Your liability for unauthorized transactions using your Card Account that take place on the Visa system without a personal identification number (PIN) is $0.00 if you are not grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your Card. This reduced liability does not apply to PIN transactions not processed by Visa (see Transactions Not Routed Through the Visa System below). (b) Transaction Not Routed Through the Visa System. Unauthorized transactions that are not routed through Visa are not protected by the Visa Zero Liability Protection policy. These types of transactions include point of sale, PIN, PINless or other debit transactions not processed by Visa.

Also, if your Card Account transaction history or other information shows transfers that you did not make or authorize, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the information is made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.

The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean the Bank and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives. In addition, “we” and “us” includes the Company and any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Cards, the Card Accounts, or this Agreement (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving contract disputes. As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in your state or municipality within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the paragraph labelled “Limitation of Liability,” the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law. This Section will survive termination of your Card Account or this Agreement as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.
