If Cash App does not receive a Qualifying Direct Deposit as described above, Cash App will terminate your enrollment in Free Overdraft Coverage and not approve any Qualifying Transactions that may result in an overdraft balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">At any time, Cash App may in its sole discretion change the existing requirements or add additional requirements at any time that you must meet in order to enroll or continue to use Free Overdraft Coverage.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Fees.</strong> Cash App will not charge you any fees or interest to be eligible or to use Free Overdraft Coverage. While there is no fee to use Free Overdraft Coverage, fees for related services continue to apply according to the terms associated with any such services, including third-party fees that may apply to ATM withdrawals and certain types of Cash Card transactions.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Repayment.</strong> Any funds deposited to your Cash App Balance (which includes your Savings Balance) with an overdraft balance will be automatically used to pay off the overdraft balance (“autopay”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may choose to opt out and disable autopay of your overdraft balance by contacting Cash App Support. If you have disabled autopay, you can pay the overdraft balance manually in the Cash App mobile application.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You cannot maintain an overdraft balance for more than 45 consecutive calendar days from the date that you initially incur the overdraft balance. If you fail to pay your overdraft balance within 45 calendar days and you are enrolled in autopay, Cash App may pull the overdraft balance from your linked Eligible Transaction Account. Cash App may also suspend or cancel your enrollment in Free Overdraft Coverage.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your use of Free Overdraft Coverage using the Cash App mobile application at any time. If you cancel your use of Free Overdraft Coverage, Cash App will not approve Qualifying Transactions that result in an overdraft balance on your Cash App Balance. If you continue to remain eligible for the feature, you may re-enroll at any time.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may suspend or terminate your use of Free Overdraft Coverage for any reason in its discretion. You agree that Cash App will not be liable to you or any third-party for any costs, fees, or losses associated with the termination of your access to Free Overdraft Coverage, including, but not limited to, insufficient funds fees, late fees, legal fees or other charges.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-5" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">V.

Description Of Service</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The peer-to-peer Service (“Peer-to-Peer Service”) allows you to send funds or receive funds for peer-to-peer personal, non-commercial purposes.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Sending Funds</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have a linked bank account or linked a credit card. If you have an Unrestricted Account you will also be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have funds available in your balance. You authorize us to move funds on your behalf. We won’t be responsible for certain incomplete transactions, as described here.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <em><strong>General.</strong></em> Once you have opened an Account and either have funds available in an Eligible Transaction Account or linked a credit card issued by a U.S.-based bank or financial institution bearing the trademark of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express Travel Related Payment Services Company, Inc. (“American Express”) (an “Eligible Credit Account), you will be able to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service. Note that your Cash App Balance will not be an “Eligible Transaction Account” until you have given us certain information and we have verified your identity, as set forth above. This means that until (a) you give us this information (b) we verify your identity and (c) you have an Unrestricted Account, you will not be able to use the Cash App Balance to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service. Your Cash App Balance is an “Eligible Transaction Account” only if you have an Unrestricted Account. With a Restricted Account, you may send funds with the Peer-to-Peer Service using an Eligible Credit Account or an Eligible Bank Account. As a party initiating a transfer (“Sender”), you will send funds to your selected recipient (“Recipient”) by designating the Recipient and the transfer amount to us (a “Payment Instruction”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <em><strong>Authorization.</strong></em> By initiating each Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your linked Eligible Transaction Account (including any Eligible Bank Account that is linked to your Account at the time of the Payment Instruction) or linked Eligible Credit Account by the amount you specify, and to send those funds to your designated Recipient (a “P2P Payment”) immediately upon your request. By submitting a Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your applicable Eligible Transaction or applicable Eligible Credit Account for P2P Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned. You can cancel this authorization by unlinking your Eligible Bank Account from your Cash Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You understand and agree that when you initiate a P2P Payment Instruction, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Eligible Transaction Account as early as the moment you initiate the Payment Instruction. However, we will complete the transfer of funds to the Recipient once the Recipient has provided all required information. You hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Recipient has provided all required information or fifteen (15) days.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <em><strong>Our Liability.</strong></em> You agree that we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of: (i) insufficient funds in your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account; (ii) malfunction of the Peer-to-Peer Service due to circumstances beyond our control or due to circumstances that you were already aware of at the time you initiated your Payment Instruction; (iii) inaccurate or insufficient Payment Instructions; or (iv) failure of the Recipient to claim the P2P Payment; or (v) either you or the Recipient does not provide us with any information that we request, or we are unable to verify your identity or the identity of the Recipient to our satisfaction.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Requesting Funds</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may also request funds to be transferred to you through the Peer-to-Peer Service by designating the amount of funds requested and your selected Sender (a “Cash Request”). If the Sender approves your Cash Request, your Cash Request will become the Sender’s Payment Instructions and be processed as described in these Cash Terms.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4.

Peer-to-Peer Service Payment Amount Limits</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you’re sending large amounts of money over the thresholds described here, you will need to provide additional ID so that we can make sure you are who you say you are.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We will require you to provide us with additional identification information if you wish to send more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) (in any one transaction or in multiple transactions) over any thirty (30) day period or to receive more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) (in any one transaction or in multiple transactions) over any thirty (30) day period. The Company may impose other limits on the amount you can send in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period, subject to some restrictions. We may adjust these limits at any time at our discretion.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6. Peer-to-Peer Service Fees</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Sending money to others through our P2P service is currently free, but we can charge fees in the future.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">There are currently no fees for sending funds via an Eligible Transaction Account using the Peer-to-Peer Service. The fee for sending funds using an Eligible Credit Account through Peer-to-Peer Service will be displayed at the time of the transaction. We reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with use of the Peer-to-Peer Service at any time subject to these Cash Terms.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7. Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Our ability to stop a P2P Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on how the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction has begun processing. P2P Payments not claimed by a Recipient for fifteen (15) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically. We will attempt to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied P2P Payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account, as applicable. If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the P2P Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">8. Invalid P2P Payments</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If we believe you received a payment that should not have been made for some reason (for example, fraud), you give us permission to reverse that payment. We are not responsible for any payments that you receive, even if you don’t know who sent the payment.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you receive a P2P Payment and we later determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Payment was invalid for any reason, you hereby authorize us to move funds from the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account in an amount equal to the P2P Payment.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable in any way for any P2P Payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">9. Risk of Fraudulent Transactions</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Peer-to-Peer Service is a money transmission service. As a result, fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of funds with no recourse.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-6" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VI.

For avoidance of doubt, the applicable Cash Card Terms are between you and the issuing bank of your card program, not the Company, and in the event of any inconsistency between these Cash Terms and the applicable Cash Card Terms, the applicable Cash Card Terms shall govern your use of the Cash Card and your relationship with the issuing bank.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Cash Card may be issued in virtual or physical form. To activate the virtual card, and to request a physical card, you need to follow in-app prompts.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We reserve the right to reject signatures and card applications for any reason. Prohibited signatures include, but are not limited to, those signatures that depict inappropriate subject matter, the intellectual property rights of others, or an ink-intensive design.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Once you receive your physical card in the mail you must follow the directions in the mailing to activate your card prior to use. Your personal identification number (“PIN”) will be the code you set as your Cash PIN, and you may reset the PIN in the Cash App. Your physical card may be cancelled, repossessed, or revoked at any time without prior notice at our discretion (including for depicting a prohibited signature) subject to applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2.

In the event you have found your card, or otherwise want to enable a disabled Cash Card, you must select the “Enable Card” option within the Cash App before your “disabled” Cash Card can be used for transactions. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized disabling and enabling activity on your device relating to your Cash Card.

You allow us to void transactions if we believe that a chargeback for the transactions will occur.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you are a seller of goods or services you will be badged with an official insignia or otherwise designated as having a “Cash for Business” account. In doing so, you are creating a Company Account (as that term is defined in the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/ua" rel="nofollow noreferrer">General Terms</a>) with us and you accept and agree to the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/payment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Payment Terms</a>.

In connection with the Payment Services (as defined in the Payment Terms), you authorize us to act as your agent for the purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf. Once you have created an Account you will be able to accept payments from Cash App users for the sale of goods and services. We will, acting on your behalf, facilitate the processing of such payment transactions. We will charge you a fee for doing so. Payments from your customers, less our fee, will be deposited to your Cash App Balance. You acknowledge and agree that you may not have all features and functionality of a standard Company Account. To protect the integrity of the system and reduce risk that a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Company Account (a “Chargeback”), in some cases where we reasonably believe a Chargeback is likely, you also direct and authorize us, as your agent, to void the transaction, rather than hold funds as described in the Payment Terms.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2.

You may only use other authorized linked accounts for such transactions.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Typically Cash for Business Sellers will be identified to you by a badge in the Cash App. By initiating a payment transaction to a Cash for Business Seller, you authorize the Cash for Business Seller to charge your applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to complete the purchase or donation and you consent to sharing information from your Account with the Cash for Business Seller. In the event you are entitled to a reversal, refund, chargeback, or other adjustment associated with any purchase you made through Cash for Business, you also authorize a credit to the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to accomplish that transaction. Purchases from Cash for Business Sellers using your Eligible Credit Account or Eligible Bank Account will be processed by the Company as agent for Cash for Business Sellers in accordance with these Cash Terms.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-8" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VIII.

Dishonored Electronic Checks</h4><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If any Electronic Check is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, including because we determine the Electronic Check is fraudulent, then we may immediately (and without further notice to you) deduct any funds from the Electronic Check that we have credited to your Cash App Balance. If we have already made funds from the Electronic Check available to you then this deduction may result in a negative Cash App Balance.

Claims by Drawee Bank</h4><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The bank that accepts your check from us may have a claim against us if there are problems with your check. Some common problems, but not all, are listed here. If we make the bank that accepts your check whole, then we may recover funds from you.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Pursuant to applicable law and the rules of the check collection system, the drawee bank or a collecting bank might pursue a warranty claim or other claim against us related to the Electronic Check, even after the check was honored and paid in full. Common grounds for claims like this include:</p><ol><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The original check, or another electronic check created from the original check, was presented for payment, either before or after the drawee bank paid the Electronic Check;</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The maker’s signature or any indorsement was forged, or the check was otherwise issued fraudulent and without the authorization of a person authorized to write checks on the account;</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The check was altered after it was made; and</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The information in the Electronic Check images did not match the information that you provided at the time that you submitted the Electronic Check, or it was not possible to verify that information because the information in the Electronic Check images was illegible.</p></li></ol><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">These are just a few examples of the reasons that the drawee bank or a collecting bank may assert a claim with respect to the Electronic Check to recover amounts paid. If we (or one of our banks or other service providers) are subject to such a claim, then we may immediately recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds (and without notice to you).</p></div></div></div><div id="section-16" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VII.

Your Ability to Withdraw or Use Funds from an Electronic Check</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may delay your access to funds while we process your check.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Our policy is to delay the availability of funds from Electronic Checks that you Successfully Submit (as defined below) with Mobile Check Capture. During the delay, you may not use the funds for transactions, including transactions to: (i) make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Seller); (ii) withdraw cash using your Cash Card; (iii) make a purchase with your Cash Card; (iv) fund a transfer to your Eligible Bank Account; (v) initiate a “Buy” transaction for virtual currency; or (vi) fund an order to purchase securities using your Cash App Investing Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">An Electronic Check is considered “Successfully Submitted” when you have received confirmation within the Cash App that the Electronic Check has been submitted and accepted by us.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. When Funds From an Electronic Check Generally Will be Available</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">This is where we tell you the cut off time for a check to be submitted in order to be counted on a specific day and potential hold periods.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The length of the delay is counted in business days from the day that you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check. Every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check before 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a business day, we will consider the Electronic Check to have been Successfully Submitted on that day. However, if you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check after 7:00 pm Eastern Time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider that the Electronic Check was Successfully Submitted on the next business day. Funds from a U.S. Treasury check will generally be available the first business day after you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, unless such deposit is subject to a hold as otherwise provided in this agreement.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Checks other than U.S. Treasury checks are subject to a hold period between 1 and 15 business days.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Checks Returned or Subject to a Refund Claim</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may make funds available to you before they clear from the paying bank. If we do, and the funds do not clear the paying bank you will be required to pay back the funds we made available to you. If you present us with a check that has been paid out by another bank and we also make funds available to you, you will be required to repay the funds to us.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In many cases, funds from an Electronic Check will be made available to you sooner than the Electronic Check can be collected from the paying bank. This means that an Electronic Check that you Successfully Submit with Mobile Check Capture could be returned unpaid after funds have been made available to you. If an Electronic Check is returned unpaid, we may immediately reverse the amount credited to your Cash App Balance for the Electronic Check. If this results in a negative balance, then you will be required to repay us this negative balance immediately. We may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If an Electronic Check is presented for payment more than once, the paying bank may recover funds paid on the Electronic Check. If this happens, we may deduct the amount of the Electronic Check from your Cash App Balance immediately. If this results in a negative balance, you will be required to repay the negative balance immediately, and we may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-17" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VIII.

You must have sufficient Fiat Currency in your Cash App Balance before submitting any “Buy” transaction. A “Buy” transaction is a sale from the Company to you.

If you set up a Recurring Buy, you authorize and instruct the Company to debit Fiat Currency from your Cash App Balance or Eligible Bank Account (as applicable) in the amount you instruct for each Recurring Buy and on the periodic interval you instruct (e.g. daily, monthly, weekly). The Company will execute each Recurring Buy in the amount and interval you instruct. Recurring Buys will be placed as market orders on the applicable day and will be executed at the then-effective Conversion Rate (defined below). Recurring Buys may not occur at the same time on each day of the periodic interval. You may not receive prior notification of Recurring Buys before they occur. The Company may set minimum transaction requirements for Recurring Buys. If you do not have sufficient funds available for any Recurring Buy, we may make additional attempts to pull funds, wait to retry on the next scheduled Recurring Buy, or cancel the Recurring Buy altogether. You may cancel Recurring Buys at any time. Recurring Buys will continue until cancelled by you or the Company. The Company may cancel or modify any Recurring Buy for any reason in its sole discretion.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>No Guarantee.</strong> The Company does not guarantee the availability of “Buy” transactions, and the act of purchasing Virtual Currency from the Company does not result in a guarantee that you may purchase supported Virtual Currency from the Company at a later time.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>Settlement.</strong> We will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete transactions within two days of the date upon which you have initiated a “Buy” transaction via the Virtual Currency Services.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-22" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">IV. Transferring Virtual Currency</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Withdrawals.</strong> You may transfer Virtual Currency, up to the total amount of Virtual Currency from your Hosted Balance to an External Virtual Currency Address, minus the fees detailed below (a “Virtual Currency Withdrawal”). You are solely responsible for providing accurate instructions and directions for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal, and we are not liable to you or any third party for any delay or loss incurred from a Virtual Currency Withdrawal executed according to your instructions. You should verify the accuracy of the External Virtual Currency Address prior to initiating a Virtual Currency Withdrawal. Virtual Currency Withdrawals may not be reversed or refunded once they have been initiated. We do not have control over any Supported Network for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal and cannot guarantee that the Supported Network will confirm the transaction or execute it correctly.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Deposits.</strong> You may transfer Virtual Currency from an External Virtual Currency Address to your Hosted Balance, minus the fees detailed below and subject to the restrictions in these terms (a “Virtual Currency Deposit”). Only supported Virtual Currencies may be deposited with Cash App, and any Virtual Currency Deposit you initiate must conform to the protocols of the receiving Virtual Currency wallet. The person initiating a Virtual Currency Deposit is solely responsible for executing the transaction correctly, including payment of any applicable network fees. We are not responsible for any erroneous or delayed Virtual Currency Deposit for any reason, including erroneous instructions or address information. Virtual Currency Deposits must be recognized by the required number of network confirmations for the relevant Supported Network, and may be delayed before appearing in your Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Transfer Limitations.</strong> We may, in our sole discretion, impose limitations or restrictions on the size, type, or manner of any transfer transactions, such as a limit on the total amount of Virtual Currency that may be transferred.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Transfer Fees.</strong> We may charge fees for Virtual Currency Deposits or Virtual Currency Withdrawals, including fees imposed by the relevant Supported Network if applicable, which will be shown to you at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Compatibility.</strong> Only supported Virtual Currencies may be transferred to or from your Hosted Balance. We are not responsible for delay or loss associated with any attempted transfer transaction of unsupported Virtual Currencies or of any Virtual Currency transaction that is not made on a Supported Network or that is incompatible with the destination address.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>Transfer Settlement Risk of Loss.</strong> Once a Virtual Currency Withdrawal or Virtual Currency Deposit is submitted to the Supported Network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient for the Supported Network to confirm the transaction, which can vary. A Virtual Currency Withdrawal or Virtual Currency Deposit is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Virtual Currency Withdrawals that are initiated from your Hosted Balance will be in a pending transaction state, and the relevant value of the pending Virtual Currency Withdrawal will not be available in your Hosted Balance. If your attempted Virtual Currency Withdrawal over a Supported Network fails, the relevant Virtual Currency amount will remain in your Hosted Balance. You bear the risk of loss of value once you have initiated a transfer transaction to or from your Hosted Balance in the event that the receipt of virtual currency is delayed and the value of virtual currency decreases during the period of delay. We are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of any errors in the initiation of a transfer transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">g. <strong>Third Parties.</strong> We are not responsible for any goods or services that you may receive from, or any action by, a third party with respect to any transfer of Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you have a dispute with any third party with respect to any Virtual Currency transfer you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-23" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">V.

In the event the “Sell” feature is available, the Company will then purchase such amount of Virtual Currency from you and deposit the value of Virtual Currency in your Cash App as Fiat Currency. The price you receive for any Virtual Currency sold to the Company may vary based on market factors, including the price and volume of the Virtual Currency you are attempting to sell.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>No Guarantee.</strong> The Company does not guarantee the availability of “Sell” transactions, or your ability to sell Virtual Currency held in your Hosted Balance.

Peer to Peer Bitcoin Transfers</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may allow you to initiate peer-to-peer bitcoin transfers to other Cash App customers within the app (each transfer, a “P2P Bitcoin Transaction”). P2P Bitcoin Transactions are “off-chain” transactions facilitated by the Company. As such they are not broadcast to the bitcoin network and will not be reflected on the public ledger. All bitcoin transferred via P2P Bitcoin Transactions are custodied by the Company. P2P Bitcoin Transactions may only be completed between Virtual Currency Accounts; if you initiate a P2P Bitcoin Transaction to a Cash App Account that is not an Virtual Currency Account, the recipient must take the necessary steps to become an Virtual Currency Account before the transaction will be completed. If the recipient fails to open a Virtual Currency Account for any reason within the required period of time, the attempted P2P Bitcoin Transaction will be voided and the bitcoin returned to your account. Once you accept a P2P Bitcoin Transaction, any subsequent P2P Bitcoin Transaction to you will be automatically completed into your Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with P2P Bitcoin Transactions at any time subject to these Virtual Currency Terms. Any fees assessed will be reflected in app at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may impose transaction limits on P2P Bitcoin Transactions in our sole discretion. Fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of Virtual Currency with no recourse. It is your responsibility to provide accurate instructions for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions, and the Company is not responsible for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions facilitated based on inaccurate or incomplete instructions. P2P Bitcoin Transactions occur in bitcoin denominations (i.e. “satoshis”). You may have the option to choose an estimated amount of a P2P Bitcoin Transaction denominated in dollars. Prior to sending any P2P Bitcoin Transaction you will be shown the amount of the transfer denominated in bitcoin; it is your responsibility to ensure that the transfer amount in bitcoin is correct. All estimated denominations of P2P Bitcoin Transactions in dollars are based on the then-effective Conversion Rate and are not a guarantee or promise of the amount of bitcoin that will be transferred. The value of bitcoin can fluctuate rapidly and the Company does not guarantee the dollar value of any P2P Bitcoin Transaction. Bitcoin received via P2P Bitcoin Transaction may lose value, and recipients will not be reimbursed for such losses.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-25" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">VII.

Conversion Rate</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may buy or sell Virtual Currency through the Virtual Currency Services. Any such buy or sell transaction is subject to the Company “Conversion Rate” for the given transaction. “Conversion Rate” means the price of Virtual Currency in terms of Fiat Currency as displayed in the Cash App once you have selected “Buy” or “Sell” and such Conversion Rate is the price in terms of Fiat Currency at which you may buy Virtual Currency from or sell Virtual Currency to the Company. You acknowledge that the Company may add a margin or “spread” between the quoted mid market price displayed on the Virtual Currency dashboard and the quoted buy or sell price and, as such, that the quoted buy price Conversion Rate may not be the same as the sell price Conversion Rate at any given time. You agree, as a condition of buying or selling Virtual Currency through the Cash App, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric.

You will be presented with a confirmation page prior to submitting the VC Custom Order instructions that will specify details about the VC Custom Order including any applicable fees.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you initiate your VC Custom Order, we will pull funds in the amount of the VC Custom Order, including any applicable fees, either (i) from your Cash App Balance in the case of a “Buy,” or (ii) from your Hosted Balance in the case of a “Sell.” If you initiate a VC Custom Order “Buy” in an amount that exceeds your current Cash App Balance, you authorize us to Add Cash to your Cash App Balance from an External Account or as otherwise permissible under the Cash App Terms, in an amount sufficient to cover your VC Custom Order and any applicable fees. You may not initiate a VC Custom Order “Sell” in an amount that exceeds your current Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Only in the event that the Conversion Rate matches the Trigger Price (the “<strong>Trigger Event</strong>”) will the contingent Buy or Sell transaction associated with your VC Custom Order execute. By initiating a VC Custom Order, you authorize the Company to place a Buy or Sell, as applicable, in the amount specified in the VC Custom Order upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event. The Trigger Event is based exclusively on the Conversion Rate, and we will determine when the Trigger Price is reached in our sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the Conversion Rate is the sole metric used for purposes of determining whether the Trigger Event has occurred, and prices for Virtual Currency on other third party exchanges, markets, or otherwise are not considered or binding. Notwithstanding any prohibition on cancellations that may apply to the Virtual Currency Services in general, you may cancel your VC Custom Order at any time prior to the occurrence of the Trigger Event. We may cancel or modify any outstanding VC Custom Order at any time without notice to you, in our sole discretion. During the time that your VC Custom Order is pending and prior to its cancellation, expiration, or the occurrence of the Trigger Event, the funds or Virtual Currency used to place the VC Custom Order will not appear in your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. If your VC Custom Order is canceled or expires, the funds or Virtual Currency, together with any fees, will be returned to your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. We will not be liable to you for any loss incurred as a result of the cancellation of your VC Custom Order.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">VC Custom Orders are an advanced order type; you should understand the risks of Virtual Currency transactions generally, and of placing advanced orders specifically, before placing a VC Custom Order. If you choose to place a VC Custom Order, you agree you do so at your own risk. Any outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability more broadly (including as a result of a service interruption caused by a third party) may impact the time that you are able to initiate or cancel your VC Custom Order. We will not be liable to you in the event that you are not able to place or cancel your VC Custom Order as a result of such outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any VC Custom Order.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-33" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">XV. Virtual Currency Gifting</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may permit you to send or receive a Virtual Currency-denominated gift to or from other Cash App users, respectively, or to receive such a gift from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction (each, a “<strong>Virtual Currency Gift</strong>”). When initiating a Virtual Currency Gift transaction, the sender does not, in fact, transfer Virtual Currency to the recipient. Rather, the sender of a Virtual Currency Gift is sending Fiat Currency to the recipient via Cash App’s Peer-to-Peer Service, using the Cash App Balance held by the sender, and Cash App will prompt the recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift to complete a Buy order to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received from the sender.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift has no obligation to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received. If the recipient chooses not to complete a Buy order upon receipt of the Virtual Current Gift, or if the recipient fails to complete a Buy order within 21 days of receiving a Virtual Currency Gift, then (i) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from another Cash App user, the gifted funds will be deposited as Fiat Currency into the recipient’s Cash App Balance, and (ii) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction, the gifted funds will be returned to us. The recipient is solely responsible for submitting a Buy order to acquire Virtual Currency using the Fiat Currency received via the Virtual Currency Gift, and such Buy order is entirely at the direction and instruction of the recipient.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You acknowledge and agree that the value of Virtual Currency at the time a sender initiates a Virtual Currency Gift may be higher or lower, relative to Fiat Currency, than the value of Virtual Currency at the time a recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift chooses to accept such gift and place a Virtual Currency Buy order. Moreover, Virtual Currency purchased by the recipient, as a result of a Virtual Currency Gift, may lose value, and any lost value will not be reimbursed or replaced by us. Purchasing bitcoin is a risky activity and may involve loss. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any VC Custom Order.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Following the receipt of a Virtual Currency Gift and the placement of a subsequent Buy order of Virtual Currency, a recipient will have to sell its Virtual Currency in order to receive any Fiat Currency. Selling Virtual Currency may have tax implications, and we will not provide any reimbursement or compensation for the tax consequences of selling Virtual Currency. If you have questions about your particular tax situation, you should consult a tax advisor.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-34" class="legal-page_legalContentSection__Rgm61"><div data-identifier="rich-text" class="formatted-text_formattedText__2_2NW"><div class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">XVI.

Cash App Investing does not make recommendations or provide investment advice.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Investing is a risky activity and may involve loss. The amount of stock purchased by the Recipient using the Gift, if any, may lose value, and any lost value will not be reimbursed or replaced by Cash App or Cash App Investing.

Selling shares may have tax implications, and neither Cash App nor Cash App Investing will provide any reimbursement or compensation for the tax consequences of selling any stock purchased using a Gift.

Remittance Service</h4><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">1. Description of the Service</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Remittance Service allows you to send Remittance Payments (defined below) from the United States to individuals in certain other countries for personal, non-commercial purposes (the “Remittance Service”).</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Sending Remittance Payments</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. General. eligible Unrestricted Accounts will be able to use the Remittance Service. As Sender, you will provide instructions to transfer funds (the “Remittance Payment Instructions”), including but not limited to instructions about the amount to be paid, the currency to be paid out, the method of payout (including information about the recipient’s bank, such as the routing number, or the name and country of the payout agent), the identity of the person to be paid (the “Designated Recipient”), and other information. You may only use the Remittance Service using funds in your Cash App Balance. If you have a Restricted Account, you will be prohibited from using the Remittance Service.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. Authorization. By initiating each Remittance Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your Cash App Balance by the amount you specify, including Cash App’s associated fees and any applicable taxes, and to send those funds to your Designated Recipient (a “Remittance Payment(s)”) immediately upon your request and selected delivery method. By submitting an Remittance Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your Cash App Balance for Remittance Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned. c. Processing Timeframe. Subject to the 30-minute cancellation procedures discussed below, you understand and agree that when you initiate a Remittance Payment, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Cash App Balance as early as the moment you initiate the Remittance Payment. If Cash App executes a Remittance Payment for you pursuant to your Remittance Payment Instruction and there aren’t sufficient funds in your Account to cover the transfer, you understand that Block’s recovery of these funds may cause your account to become negative. d. Method of Payout. As part of the Remittance Payment Instruction, Sender must select a delivery method for the Remittance Payment. The Sender may select either (1) cash pickup at a paying agent location we have partnered with or (2) deposit into the Designated Recipient’s bank account in the destination country.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Cancellations and Refunds</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Within 30 minutes of your Remittance Payment, you have the right to cancel for a full refund, including fees, unless the recipient has already picked up the money or the funds have been deposited into the recipient’s account.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. 30-Minute Cancellation and Right to Refund</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You have the right to cancel a Remittance Payment and obtain a refund of all funds paid to us, including fees. In order to cancel, you must contact us by either calling 1-800-969-1940 or by contacting us through your Account in the app within 30 minutes of payment for the transfer (the “Cancellation Period”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you contact us, you must provide us with information to help us identify the transfer you wish to cancel, including the amount and the location where the funds were sent. We will refund your money within 3 business days of your cancellation request as long as the funds have not already been picked up or deposited into the Designated Recipient’s bank account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. Automatic Cancellations and Refunds Subject to applicable law, if Sender selects cash pickup as the delivery method for a Remittance Payment and the Designated Recipient either fails to pick up the money transfer or fails to sufficiently verify their identity as required within 21 days after the available pickup date provided on the Sender’s receipt, the money transfer will be canceled automatically. Such identity verification requirements may include, but are not limited to, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering compliance review. For any canceled Remittance Payment, we will refund you and return to you any unclaimed, refused, refunded, or denied Remittance Payment to your Cash App Balance unless we are prohibited from doing so under law. If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the Remittance Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law. All refunds will be in USD. All refunds will be processed within thirty (30) days of the date of cancellation.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4. Remittance Service Fees</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will be charged certain fees in connection with your use of the Remittance Service.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The fees for using the Remittance Service are found in Section I. “Stored Balance Disclosures“ of the Cash App Terms and will be disclosed in-app prior to your submission of a Remittance Payment Instruction. We reserve the right to change the fees associated with use of the Remittance Service at any time with reasonable notice, subject to these Cash App Terms and applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">5. Currency Exchange Rate</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may make money on the exchange rate applied to your transaction.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">All Remittance Payments will be funded in United States dollars (“USD”) and paid to the Designated Recipient in the official currency of the destination country. In some countries and subject to availability, you may be able to choose a payout currency other than the official local currency. Subject to applicable law, we disclose the actual exchange rate or an estimated exchange rate that applies to your transaction before you submit payment for the transaction and on your receipt. If the Remittance Payment involves an exchange of currencies, the retail exchange rate we quote for individual senders may be different from the wholesale exchange rate we obtain in commercial transactions with our foreign exchange providers. The difference between the retail exchange rate applied to your Remittance Payment and the wholesale exchange rate at which we acquired the payout currency will be kept by Cash App and/or the paying agent as revenue, in addition to any fees disclosed on your receipt or in Section I. Cash App’s paying agent must pay out money transfers in the payout currency indicated on your receipt.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6. Payment and Transaction Limits</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may limit, prohibit, or require you to provide us with additional identification information based on the number of Remittance Payments you send over any period of time. We may also impose other limits, including but not limited to, on the amount you can send in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any period of time and/or to certain countries, subject to some restrictions. We may adjust these limits at any time at our discretion subject to applicable laws.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7. Risk of Fraudulent Transactions</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Be on the lookout for fraud. While we make efforts to identify and reduce the impact of fraudulent scams on our customers, sometimes, scammers are successful. The Remittance Service is a money transmission service. As a result, please be aware and vigilant that fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of your funds with no recourse.</p></div></div></div></div><nav
