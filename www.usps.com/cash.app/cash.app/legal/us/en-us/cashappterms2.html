Eligibility and Account Registration</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Using Cash App requires that you open an account. You need to be a U.S. resident and at least 18 years old. If you want to use your account balance to send money to another Cash App customer or use certain Cash App products or services, then you’ll need to give us some more information about you that we will use to verify your identity.<br/><br/>This is also the part where you tell us you own the email or phone number you registered with and that the personal information you provide to us is correct. You agree to cooperate with us so that we can verify your identity. We might use third parties to help us do so.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You must be a resident of the United States, at least 18 years and the age of majority in your State of residence, and you must register for an account (your “Account”) to use the Service. Certain features of the Service may only be available for use in the United States. Some features, such as the ability to send money to another Cash App customer with the balance in your Account, may be available only if you provide us with certain information about you and we are able to verify your identity. We verify your identity on our own behalf and to facilitate certain of our partners, including our banking partners, in meeting their own obligations.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>A. Registering, Opening, Using, Upgrading, or Switching an Account</strong></p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">To register, open, use, upgrade, or switch an Account, the Company may require that you submit certain information about yourself and your business to the Company, including but not limited to your legal name, email address, text-enabled mobile phone number, street address, zip code, date of birth, social security number, a government issued form of identification, legal business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and any information you subsequently add or update (“Account Information”). You represent and warrant that all Account Information you provide the Company to register, open, use, upgrade, or switch an Account, including but not limited to a Cash for Business Account is true and accurate, and you agree to keep all Account Information current. All Account Information is subject to the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_self" href="copyright-trademark.html" rel="">Cash App Copyright and Trademark Policy</a>.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>B. Restricted Accounts</strong></p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you first open your Account, it will be a “Restricted Account.” With a Restricted Account, you may link an external, U.S.-issued bank account (an “Eligible Bank Account” as defined below) to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including payments made to a Cash for Business Account, defined below), and you may transfer funds from your Cash App Balance (defined below) to your Eligible Bank Account, but you will not be able to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Account) using your Cash App Balance or use certain Services. If you have a Restricted Account and you attempt to make a payment to another Cash App customer from your Cash App Balance or use certain Services, then you will be given the option of upgrading your Account to an “Unrestricted Account.” To upgrade your Account, you will need to provide us with certain personal information so that we can verify your identity.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>C. Validating and Authenticating Your Identity</strong> You hereby authorize the Company, directly or through the Company&#x27;s use of third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity or authenticate your identity and Account Information and, for Cash for Business Accounts, the identity of the business. This may include asking you for further information or documentation about your Account usage or identity, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, mobile phone number or financial instruments, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. When we initially verify your identity, your Account will convert from a Restricted Account to an Unrestricted Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In connection with your use of the Service, you may not refuse to (a) cooperate in an investigation concerning activity that potentially violates the law or the Terms, (b) provide confirmation of your identity, or (c) provide confirmation of any information you provide us. If you decline to provide us with the information that we request or if we cannot verify your identity to our satisfaction (in our sole judgment and discretion) for any reason, then your Account will remain a Restricted Account and you will not be able to use your Cash App Balance to make payments to other Cash App customers or use certain Services. In addition, we reserve the right to change the account type or suspend or terminate the Account or access to certain Services of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The first time you access your Account using a new device we may require you to authenticate your Account with additional information. If your Account cannot be verified you may be required to set up a new Account.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Sponsored Accounts</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. You may authorize Accounts for up to four (4) people who are 13 years of age or older (each, a “Sponsored Person” and each such Account, a “Sponsored Account”). Any minor Sponsored Person who uses a Sponsored Account must do so only with the consent of their parent or legal guardian, who must themselves be of majority age. For the purposes of the Cash App Terms, any reference to your “Account” includes any associated Sponsored Accounts. You acknowledge that the Cash App Terms and Privacy Notice will apply to you with respect to each Sponsored Account and to each Sponsored Person, and you hereby expressly accept these Cash App Terms and Privacy Notice on behalf of each Sponsored Person and Sponsored Account. You further agree to and accept full responsibility and liability for any Sponsored Person’s use of a Sponsored Account, including but not limited to (a) any transactions made by the Sponsored Account; (b) any transaction made by others if an Sponsored Person allows them to use such Sponsored Account; (c) fees and charges resulting from any transaction made by a Sponsored Person or others if a Sponsored Person allows them to use such Sponsored Account, including but not limited to your Account Information; and (d) any other financial charges and legal liability that a Sponsored Person may incur in connection with their use of a Sponsored Account. You further acknowledge that you are the sole owner of the Sponsored Account and the Sponsored Person is the sole owner of any funds held in the Cash App Balance and/or the Savings Balance (defined in the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_self" href="savings.html" rel="">Cash App Savings Terms of Service</a>) of the Sponsored Account. For avoidance of doubt, at all times, the Sponsored Person has the sole right to access, use, and withdraw any funds held in the Sponsored Account, subject to any feature access requirements described in Section III.2.b (Feature Access) below. You allow us to discuss the Sponsored Account with a Sponsored Person. By authorizing a Sponsored Account, you represent that you have permission to allow us to use and share information about the Sponsored Person as described in the Privacy Notice and as allowed by applicable law. This includes information we may get from you, any Sponsored Person, and information about their transactions and use of a Sponsored Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may withdraw your authorization at any time by contacting Cash App Support through the app or by calling 1-800-969-1940. If your Account is suspended or terminated, your authorization for any Sponsored Accounts will be automatically withdrawn. If your authorization for any Sponsored Account is withdrawn for any reason, the Sponsored Person may request a new sponsor for the Sponsored Account subject to the requirements in the Cash App Terms and Privacy Notice. Until a new sponsor is appointed to the Sponsored Account, access to any features for the Sponsored Account may be limited, except to the extent the Sponsored Person seeks to Cash Out to an Eligible Bank Account. Without limiting any other provision of these Cash App Terms, we may terminate your Account if any Sponsored Person associated with you violates these Cash App Terms.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If the Sponsored Account is terminated, suspended or closed for any reason, we may take the steps outlined in Sections XIII.8 (Termination of Account), XIII.9 (Effect of Termination), XIII.10 (Services Upon Closure of Account).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. Feature Access. Sponsored Accounts will have access to certain Cash App features, such as Peer-to-Peer Transactions and the Cash Card. Sponsored Accounts may not have access to all Cash App features, or access to such features may be limited. To access certain Cash App features, you and the Sponsored Person may be required to accept additional terms, provide further information to Cash App, open additional accounts with Cash App or its partners, or transfer ownership of any funds or other assets held in the Sponsored Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you authorize a Sponsored Account, you also authorize that Sponsored Person to “Add Cash” to the Sponsored Account as outlined in Section VI.2 (Funding Your Cash App Balance.) To the extent an “Add Cash” method is offered through a third party, you agree to and accept full responsibility for any Sponsored Person’s use of such service for the Sponsored Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. Limits for Sponsored Persons. We reserve the right to impose transaction limits and to restrict spending from Sponsored Accounts at specific merchants or industries at our sole discretion.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. Account Graduation. You agree that any Sponsored Person who is of majority age may initiate a request to become the sole owner of the Sponsored Account by providing the information described in Section III.1.C above (Validating and Authenticating Your Identity). Once we verify their identity, a previously Sponsored Person will become the sole owner of the Sponsored Account, including the sole owner of any funds or other assets held in the Sponsored Account, and any associated Cash Card.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. Allowances. You may set up recurring P2P payments to your Sponsored Account(s) on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. These payments will count towards your and the Sponsored Account’s transaction limits.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. $Cashtags</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may choose a unique username for Cash App, which will be your “$Cashtag.” If you choose a $Cashtag that is confusing or deceptive, we may change it.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may select a unique alpha-numeric name to identify yourself on the Service (a “$Cashtag”). You may not select a $Cashtag that we believe, in our sole discretion, misleads or deceives others regarding your business or personal identity or that creates an undue risk of chargebacks or mistaken payments. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without any liability to you, to require that you change your $Cashtag or Account Information, and to deactivate your account or reclaim or make unavailable your $Cashtag.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4. Cash App Fees</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The fees for using Cash App are found in the &quot;Stored Balance Disclosures&quot; Section of these Cash App Terms. We reserve the right to charge for, or change the fees associated with, the use of Cash App at any time subject to reasonable notice and these Cash App Terms. A fee may be imposed by the Company or an ATM operator for use of the Cash Card (defined below) at an ATM, including for a balance inquiry, and by any network used to complete the ATM transaction, as described in your Cash Card Terms (defined below).</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">5. FDIC Pass-Through Insurance</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures eligible deposits (up to $250,000) in the event the bank holding the funds fails. If you have been issued a Cash Card as described in Section VIII of this agreement, your Cash App Balance and your Savings Balance are covered by FDIC insurance on a pass-through basis through our partner bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Member FDIC (“pass-through insurance”). Additionally, if you sponsor one or more Sponsored Account(s), your and the Sponsored Account’s Cash App Balances and Savings Balances are covered by FDIC pass-through insurance, regardless of whether you or the Sponsored Account has been issued a Cash Card. If you have multiple accounts, and/or multiple Sponsored Accounts, they are included under the same insurance coverage.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you have not been issued a Cash Card and you do not sponsor a Sponsored Account, your Cash App Balance and your Savings Balance are not eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. Bitcoin and Investing holdings are not covered by FDIC pass-through insurance.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6. Gift Cards</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may permit you to send a “Gift Card” for a designated merchant to a Recipient. To receive a Gift Card, the Recipient must have a Cash App Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">To accept the Gift Card for use with the designated merchant, the Recipient must have a Cash Card. Gift Cards are not redeemable for cash value, except that Recipients with a Cash Card may redeem the cash value of the Gift Card to their Cash App Balance once the Gift Card value falls below $10. A Gift Card can only be used with a Cash Card purchase at the designated merchant.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If the Recipient does not have a Cash Card, they may elect to add the cash value of the Gift Card to their Cash App Balance, or they may request a Cash Card as described in Section VIII.1 (Issuance of the Cash Card) below and then accept the Gift Card. If the Recipient does not accept the Gift Card within 30 days of receipt, the cash value of the Gift Card will be added to their Cash App Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App does not guarantee the availability of Gift Cards for any merchant. There are no fees to send or accept a Gift Card, and once a Recipient accepts a Gift Card, it does not expire. The minimum send amount is $1, and the maximum send amount is $2,000 per sender, per day. If a Recipient accepts multiple Gift Cards for the same merchant, they will be combined into a single balance for use with that merchant.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">IV.

You are also authorizing us to move funds to your applicable Eligible Bank Account or applicable debit card for instructions to add funds that are canceled or otherwise returned. You can cancel this authorization by unlinking your Eligible Bank Account or debit card from your Cash Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Limitations.</strong> The Company may impose limits on the amount you can keep in your Cash App Balance and reserves the right to change these limits at any time. Funds in your Cash App Balance might not be available to use for all types of transactions. If you have a Restricted Account, then you may not use your Cash App Balance to make payments to other Cash App customers (including Cash for Business Account) unless you first upgrade to an Unrestricted Account.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Funding Your Cash App Balance</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">There are several ways you can add funds to your Cash App Balance (“Add Cash”), which are described here.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Subject to the limitations described in Section VI.1(c), you can keep funds received from P2P Payments (defined below) made to you through the Cash App in your Cash App Balance. <br/><br/>Once you have an Unrestricted Account, we may offer you the ability to “Add Cash” to your Cash App Balance in other ways, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>External Account.</strong></p><ul><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><em><strong>Eligible Bank Account. </strong></em>You may use funds from your Eligible Bank Account to fund your Cash App Balance.</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><em><strong>Debit Card. </strong></em>You may link a debit card to fund your Cash App Balance. To do so, you must have a valid debit card issued by a U.S. bank or financial institution bearing the Visa Inc. (“Visa”), MasterCard International Inc. (“MasterCard”), or DFS Services, LLC (“Discover”) logo. Any such debit card, collectively with your Cash App Balance (if you have an Unrestricted Account) and an Eligible Bank Account, is referred to herein as an “Eligible Transaction Account”.</p></li></ul><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Direct Deposit.</strong> You may direct payments made to you from your employer or otherwise into your Cash App Balance using the bank routing and account numbers provided to you by our bank partner pursuant to the Cash App direct deposit program (the “Direct Deposit”). Deposits made using such bank routing and account number will be credited to your Cash App Balance for use in accordance with these Cash App Terms.

Transferring Funds to Your Bank Account</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You can transfer funds from your Cash App balance out to your bank account (“Cash Out”). These transfers can take up to three days, or for a fee, be made instantly. We may limit your ability to transfer funds to your bank account, based on the circumstances. For example, we may delay transfers while we screen for fraud or risks. You are responsible for all amounts owed on your account even after it is closed.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Transfers to Your Bank Account.</strong> You may electronically transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to an Eligible Bank Account (“Cash Out”). By selecting an Eligible Bank Account as your deposit source you are requesting that we settle an electronic transfer to your bank account. The Company will settle these electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association (“NACHA”)) to your Eligible Bank Account in the amount you instruct, and you will not be able to cancel the ACH transfer. Such transfer to your Eligible Bank Account via ACH will typically arrive within three (3) business days.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Instant Deposit.</strong> If this feature is available to you, you may Cash Out from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account subject to the fees detailed in the Instant Deposit experience.

In addition, you may not transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account to evade a payment investigation. If you attempt to transfer your Cash App Balance while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold your funds at our discretion to protect the Company or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability. We also may defer or redirect payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law, subpoena or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity. You will remain liable for all obligations related to your Account even after the Account is closed.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4.

Your funds will be held in pooled bank accounts with the funds of other Cash App customers.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you do hold funds in your Cash App Balance and/or your Savings Balance, the Company will hold such funds separate from its corporate funds and will not use your funds for any corporate purposes, nor will the Company voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Company will combine your funds with the funds of other customers and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in the Company&#x27;s name.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6.

Free Overdraft Coverage</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>General.</strong> Cash App offers you, if eligible, the ability to enroll in an optional, no-fee overdraft feature (“Free Overdraft Coverage”) that allows you to overdraw on your Cash App Balance for Cash Card purchase transactions, ATM withdrawals, and cash-back transactions, but excluding ACH transfers (“Qualifying Transactions”), up to a specified amount no greater than $50 (the “Limit”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Limit is determined by Cash App in its sole discretion based on your account history, direct deposit history, spending activity, and other risk-based factors. Your Limit may be adjusted from time to time in Cash App’s sole discretion. Your Limit may be increased or decreased at any time by Cash App and represents the maximum amount by which you may overdraw on your Cash App Balance on Qualifying Transactions. Any changes to your Limit will be communicated to you and also displayed within your Cash App mobile application.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Free Overdraft Coverage is only available for Qualifying Transactions. Other transactions will continue to be declined if there are insufficient funds in your Cash App Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Eligibility.</strong> Eligibility for Free Overdraft Coverage is determined by Cash App in its sole discretion. Among other factors, to be eligible for Free Overdraft Coverage, you must have received at least $300 in Qualifying Direct Deposits in the preceding calendar month. A Qualifying Direct Deposit means a direct deposit by ACH transfer of payroll, pension or government benefits from your employer or a government agency. You must continue to meet the Qualifying Direct Deposit requirement each month to maintain your enrollment in Free Overdraft Coverage. If Cash App does not receive a Qualifying Direct Deposit as described above, Cash App will terminate your enrollment in Free Overdraft Coverage and not approve any Qualifying Transactions that may result in an overdraft balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">At any time, Cash App may in its sole discretion change the existing requirements or add additional requirements at any time that you must meet in order to enroll or continue to use Free Overdraft Coverage.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Fees.</strong> Cash App will not charge you any fees or interest to be eligible or to use Free Overdraft Coverage. While there is no fee to use Free Overdraft Coverage, fees for related services continue to apply according to the terms associated with any such services, including third-party fees that may apply to ATM withdrawals and certain types of Cash Card transactions.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Repayment.</strong> Any funds deposited to your Cash App Balance with an overdraft balance will be automatically used to pay off the overdraft balance (“autopay”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may choose to opt out and disable autopay of your overdraft balance by contacting Cash App Support. If you have disabled autopay, you can pay the overdraft balance manually in the Cash App mobile application. <br/><br/>You cannot maintain an overdraft balance for more than 45 consecutive calendar days from the date that you initially incur the overdraft balance. If you fail to pay your overdraft balance within 45 calendar days and you are enrolled in autopay, Cash App may pull the overdraft balance from your linked Eligible Transaction Account. Cash App may also suspend or cancel your enrollment in Free Overdraft Coverage.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your use of Free Overdraft Coverage using the Cash App mobile application at any time. If you cancel your use of Free Overdraft Coverage, Cash App will not approve Qualifying Transactions that result in an overdraft balance on your Cash App Balance. If you continue to remain eligible for the feature, you may re-enroll at any time.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may suspend or terminate your use of Free Overdraft Coverage for any reason in its discretion. You agree that Cash App will not be liable to you or any third-party for any costs, fees, or losses associated with the termination of your access to Free Overdraft Coverage, including, but not limited to, insufficient funds fees, late fees, legal fees or other charges.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VII. Peer-to-Peer Service</h4><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">1. Description Of Service</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The peer-to-peer Service (“Peer-to-Peer Service”) allows you to send funds or receive funds for peer-to-peer personal, non-commercial purposes.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Sending Funds</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have a linked bank account or linked a credit card. If you have an Unrestricted Account you will also be able to send funds using our P2P service from your balance. You authorize us to move funds on your behalf. We won’t be responsible for certain incomplete transactions, as described here.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>General</strong>. Once you have opened an Account and either have funds available in an Eligible Transaction Account or linked a credit card issued by a U.S.-based bank or financial institution bearing the trademark of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express Travel Related Payment Services Company, Inc. (“American Express”) (an “Eligible Credit Account), you will be able to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service. Note that your Cash App Balance will not be an “Eligible Transaction Account” until you have given us certain information and we have verified your identity, as set forth above. This means that until (a) you give us this information (b) we verify your identity and (c) you have an Unrestricted Account, you will not be able to use the Cash App Balance to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service. With a Restricted Account, you will not be able to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Account) using your Cash App Balance. You may only send funds with the Peer-to-Peer Service using an Eligible Credit Account or an Eligible Bank Account. As a party initiating a transfer (“Sender”), you will send funds to your selected recipient (“Recipient”) by designating the Recipient and the transfer amount to us (a “Payment Instruction”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Authorization</strong>. By initiating each Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your linked Eligible Transaction Account (including any Eligible Bank Account that is linked to your Account at the time of the Payment Instruction) or linked Eligible Credit Account by the amount you specify, and to send those funds to your designated Recipient (a “P2P Payment”) immediately upon your request. By submitting a Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your applicable Eligible Transaction or applicable Eligible Credit Account for P2P Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned. You can cancel this authorization by unlinking your Eligible Bank Account from your Cash Account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You understand and agree that when you initiate a P2P Payment Instruction, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Eligible Transaction Account as early as the moment you initiate the Payment Instruction. However, we will complete the transfer of funds to the Recipient once the Recipient has provided all required information. You hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Recipient has provided all required information or fifteen (15) days.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Our Liability</strong>. We shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete a P2P Payment Instruction because of inaccurate or insufficient Payment Instructions, or the failure of the Recipient to claim the P2P Payment, or because either you or the Recipient does not provide us with any information that we request, or we are unable to verify your identity or the identity of the Recipient to our satisfaction.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Funding Sources Used for Payments Made Through the Service</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may link an Eligible Bank Account to your Cash App to fund payments. The Company reserves the right to limit which banks or what types of accounts constitute an Eligible Bank Account. When you initiate a payment through the Cash App, if you have a Restricted Account, then you will not be able to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Account) using your Cash App Balance. If you have a Restricted Account and you wish to make a payment to another Cash App customer, you may: (1) use an Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account; or (2) upgrade to an Unrestricted Account to make the payment with your Cash App Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you have an Unrestricted Account and have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to satisfy the full payment amount you can choose whether you want the payment fulfilled by your Cash App Balance, Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to cover the full transaction, then you may choose the funding source from your Eligible Transaction Accounts or Eligible Credit Accounts.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4. Requesting Funds</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may also request funds to be transferred to you through the Peer-to-Peer Service by designating the amount of funds requested and your selected Sender (a “Cash Request”). If the Sender approves your Cash Request, your Cash Request will become the Sender’s Payment Instructions and be processed as described in these Cash App Terms.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">5.

Peer-to-Peer Service Payment Amount Limits</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you’re sending large amounts of money over certain thresholds, you will need to provide additional identification information so that we can make sure you are who you say you are.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We will require you to provide us with additional identification information if you wish to send more than your limits in any one transaction or in multiple transactions. We may impose transaction limits over any period of time and over the lifetime of your account, subject to some restrictions. We may adjust these limits at any time at our discretion.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7. Peer-to-Peer Service Fees</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You can send money to others through our P2P service for free, unless you choose to send funds using a credit card. We can change these fees in the future.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">There are currently no fees for sending funds via an Eligible Transaction Account using the Peer-to-Peer Service. The fee for sending funds using an Eligible Credit Account through Peer-to-Peer Service will be displayed at the time of the transaction. We reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with use of the Peer-to-Peer Service at any time with reasonable notice, subject to these Cash App Terms.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">8. Payment Cancelation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Our ability to stop or cancel a P2P Payment Instruction depends on how the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction has begun processing. We are not required to stop, cancel, or recover funds associated with a misdirected Payment Instruction.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">P2P Payments not claimed by a Recipient fifteen (15) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically. We will attempt to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied P2P Payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account, as applicable. If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the P2P Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">9. Invalid P2P Payments</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If we believe you received a payment that should not have been made for some reason (for example, fraud), you give us permission to reverse that payment. We are not responsible for any payments that you receive, even if you don’t know who sent the payment.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you receive a P2P Payment and we later determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Payment was invalid for any reason, you hereby authorize us to move funds from the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account in an amount equal to the P2P Payment.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable in any way for any P2P Payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">10. Risk of Fraudulent Transactions</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Peer-to-Peer Service is a money transmission service. As a result, fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of funds with no recourse.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">VIII.

Issuance of the Cash Card</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">A bank may provide you with a virtual or physical Cash Card. By requesting the Cash Card, you agree to any additional applicable terms from the issuing bank. We may cancel, repossess, or revoke your Cash Card at any time.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Company may arrange for an issuing bank to provide you with access to a debit card (a “Cash Card”). By using the Cash Card, you agree to the issuing bank’s terms, as applicable (each the “Cash Card Terms”), which may be updated from time to time. For avoidance of doubt, the applicable Cash Card Terms are between you and the issuing bank of your card program, not the Company, and in the event of any inconsistency between these Cash App Terms and the applicable Cash Card Terms, the applicable Cash Card Terms shall govern your use of the Cash Card and your relationship with the issuing bank.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Cash Card may be issued in virtual or physical form. To activate the virtual card, and to request a physical card, you will need to follow in-app prompts.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may have the option to design your own card. If you choose to redesign your card, we may charge an additional fee. We reserve the right to reject designs or signatures and card applications for any reason. Prohibited signatures include, but are not limited to, those signatures that depict inappropriate subject matter, the intellectual property rights of others, or an ink-intensive design.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Once you receive your physical card in the mail you must follow the directions in the mailing to activate your card prior to use. Your personal identification number (“PIN”) will be the code you set as your Cash PIN, and you may reset the PIN in the Cash App. Your physical card may be canceled, repossessed, or revoked at any time without prior notice at our discretion (including for depicting a prohibited signature) subject to applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2.

In the event you have found your card, or otherwise want to enable a disabled Cash Card, you must select the “Enable Card” option within the Cash App before your “disabled” Cash Card can be used for transactions. You are responsible for preventing unauthorized disabling and enabling activity on your device relating to your Cash Card.

You should therefore carefully consider whether transacting or holding Virtual Currency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">1. Definitions</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Defined terms will have the same meaning as those found in the Cash App Terms, unless otherwise re-defined herein. Capitalized terms in these Virtual Currency Terms will have the following meanings:</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>External Virtual Currency Address</strong>” means any Virtual Currency address, wallet, or account that is maintained outside of the Services, and is not owned, controlled, or operated by the Company.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>Fiat Currency</strong>” means government-issued currency.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>Hosted Balance</strong>” means the Virtual Currency you have purchased for or deposited in your Virtual Currency Account (defined below) which you own and the Company holds for your benefit as a specific deposit. As a specific depositor, you continue to own the Virtual Currency in your Hosted Balance. The Company only keeps possession of your Hosted Balance for your benefit as a specific depositor.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>Supported Network</strong>” means any blockchain network, second-layer protocol built on top of a blockchain network, or other Virtual Currency network or protocol that we may make available to you in connection with some or all of the Virtual Currency Services.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>” means bitcoin and other virtual currency that may be purchased, sold, saved and transferred using the Cash App.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">“<strong>Virtual Currency Services</strong>” means the bitcoin and other virtual currency services available in Cash App.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Virtual Currency Account</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Eligibility.</strong> To be able to access and use the Virtual Currency Services, you must have a “Virtual Currency Account.” To register for a Virtual Currency Account you must: (a) have an Account, (b) be an individual person, not an entity, using the Virtual Currency Services for personal use, (c) be a resident of the United States, (d) be at least 18 years, and the age of majority in your State of residence, or older, (e) use the Virtual Currency Services in the United States, and (f) have provided the information as discussed in the next section.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Identity Verification.</strong> In order to use the Virtual Currency Services, you may be required to provide the Company with certain personal information in addition to the Account Information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number), source of funds and employment information. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update the Company if any information changes.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Availability.</strong> The Company may not make all of the Virtual Currency Services available in all markets and jurisdictions, and may restrict or prohibit use of all or a portion of the Virtual Currency Services from certain states, territories, or jurisdictions (“Restricted Locations”). You must not attempt to use the Virtual Currency Services if you are located in any of those Restricted Locations. You must not attempt to circumvent any restrictions imposed via the Virtual Currency Services, such as by obscuring your IP address or submitting any inaccurate information regarding your location.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Purchasing Virtual Currency</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Funding.</strong> In order to complete a purchase transaction via the Virtual Currency Services, you must first hold Fiat Currency in your Cash App Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Authorization.</strong> When you submit a Virtual Currency purchase order (a &quot;Buy&quot;) via the Virtual Currency Services, you authorize us to execute a Virtual Currency purchase transaction in the amount you instruct and debit your Cash App Balance in the total amount of the Buy transaction, including any applicable fees.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Buy Transaction.</strong> To initiate a Buy you will choose the amount of Virtual Currency you wish to buy from the Company using Fiat Currency from your Cash App Balance and tap “Buy”. You must have sufficient Fiat Currency in your Cash App Balance before submitting any “Buy” transaction. A “Buy” transaction is a sale from the Company to you. Once complete, your Hosted Balance will reflect the amount of Virtual Currency that you own. All right to and title in the Virtual Currency bought will pass from the Company to you. A Buy will not necessarily result in the Company broadcasting any transaction to a Virtual Currency network.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Auto-Invest and Recurring Buys.</strong> You may be able to set recurring Buy transactions to purchase Virtual Currency in Cash App (a “Recurring Buy”) at periodic intervals of your choosing. If you set up a Recurring Buy, you authorize and instruct the Company to debit Fiat Currency from your Cash App Balance or Eligible Bank Account (as applicable) in the amount you instruct for each Recurring Buy and on the periodic interval you instruct (e.g. daily, monthly, weekly). The Company will execute each Recurring Buy in the amount and interval you instruct. Recurring Buys will be placed as market orders on the applicable day and will be executed at the then-effective Conversion Rate (defined below). Recurring Buys may not occur at the same time on each day of the periodic interval. You may not receive prior notification of Recurring Buys before they occur. The Company may set minimum transaction requirements for Recurring Buys. If you do not have sufficient funds available for any Recurring Buy, we may make additional attempts to pull funds, wait to retry on the next scheduled Recurring Buy, or cancel the Recurring Buy altogether. You may cancel Recurring Buys at any time. Recurring Buys will continue until canceled by you or the Company. The Company may cancel or modify any Recurring Buy for any reason in its sole discretion.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Round-Ups.</strong> You may be able to set recurring purchases of bitcoin each time you use your Cash Card through the Round Ups feature (a “Round Up”). If you set up and enable Round Ups, you authorize and instruct the Company to debit Fiat Currency from your Cash App balance to purchase bitcoin on your behalf for the Round Up amount each time your Cash Card is used.. The amount of each Round Up will be determined by “rounding up” your Cash Card purchase to the next whole dollar amount when the Cash Card transaction settles and purchasing bitcoin in that amount at the then-effective Conversion Rate (defined below). Your Cash Card transaction may settle 1-3 days after you use your Cash Card. Cash Card transaction settlement times may vary, and the Cash Card transaction amount may change (for example, if you add a tip). The price of Bitcoin may vary at the time a Round Up is made. Cash App Investing may set minimum transaction requirements for Round Ups. You may disable Round Ups at any time, but we may be unable to stop pending Round Ups. Cash App may cancel or modify any Round Up for any reason in its sole discretion. If you do not have sufficient funds available for any Round Up, we may make additional attempts to pull funds, wait to retry on your next Round Up, or cancel the Round Up altogether. In the event that a Round Up is made as a result of an unauthorized Cash Card transaction, you may submit a dispute to correct the Round Up by contacting <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_self" href="../../../support.html" rel="">Cash App Support</a>.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>No Guarantee.</strong> The Company does not guarantee the availability of “Buy” transactions, and the act of purchasing Virtual Currency from the Company does not result in a guarantee that you may purchase supported Virtual Currency from the Company at a later time.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">g. <strong>Settlement.</strong> We will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete transactions within two days of the date upon which you have initiated a “Buy” transaction via the Virtual Currency Services.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4. Transferring Virtual Currency</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Withdrawals.</strong> You may transfer Virtual Currency, up to the total amount of Virtual Currency from your Hosted Balance to an External Virtual Currency Address, minus the fees detailed below (a “Virtual Currency Withdrawal”). You are solely responsible for providing accurate instructions and directions for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal, and we are not liable to you or any third party for any delay or loss incurred from a Virtual Currency Withdrawal executed according to your instructions. You should verify the accuracy of the External Virtual Currency Address prior to initiating a Virtual Currency Withdrawal. Virtual Currency Withdrawals may not be reversed or refunded once they have been initiated. We do not have control over any Supported Network for any Virtual Currency Withdrawal and cannot guarantee that the Supported Network will confirm the transaction or execute it correctly.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Deposits.</strong> You may transfer Virtual Currency from an External Virtual Currency Address to your Hosted Balance, minus the fees detailed below and subject to the restrictions in these terms (a “Virtual Currency Deposit”). Only supported Virtual Currencies may be deposited with Cash App, and any Virtual Currency Deposit you initiate must conform to the protocols of the receiving Virtual Currency wallet. The person initiating a Virtual Currency Deposit is solely responsible for executing the transaction correctly, including payment of any applicable network fees. We are not responsible for any erroneous or delayed Virtual Currency Deposit for any reason, including erroneous instructions or address information. Virtual Currency Deposits must be recognized by the required number of network confirmations, or otherwise authorized pursuant to network confirmation requirements, for the relevant Supported Network, and may be delayed before appearing in your Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Transfer Limitations.</strong> We may, in our sole discretion, impose limitations or restrictions on the size, type, or manner of any transfer transactions, such as a limit on the total amount of Virtual Currency that may be transferred.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Transfer Fees.</strong> We may charge fees for Virtual Currency Deposits or Virtual Currency Withdrawals, including fees imposed by the relevant Supported Network if applicable, which will be shown to you at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Compatibility.</strong> Only supported Virtual Currencies may be transferred to or from your Hosted Balance. We are not responsible for delay or loss associated with any attempted transfer transaction of unsupported Virtual Currencies or of any Virtual Currency transaction that is not made on a Supported Network or that is incompatible with the destination address.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>Transfer Settlement Risk of Loss.</strong> Once a Virtual Currency Withdrawal or Virtual Currency Deposit is submitted to the Supported Network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient for the Supported Network to confirm the transaction, which can vary. A Virtual Currency Withdrawal or Virtual Currency Deposit is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Virtual Currency Withdrawals that are initiated from your Hosted Balance will be in a pending transaction state, and the relevant value of the pending Virtual Currency Withdrawal will not be available in your Hosted Balance. If your attempted Virtual Currency Withdrawal over a Supported Network fails, the relevant Virtual Currency amount will remain in your Hosted Balance. You bear the risk of loss of value once you have initiated a transfer transaction to or from your Hosted Balance in the event that the receipt of virtual currency is delayed and the value of virtual currency decreases during the period of delay. We are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of any errors in the initiation of a transfer transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">g. <strong>Third Parties.</strong> We are not responsible for any goods or services that you may receive from, or any action by, a third party with respect to any transfer of Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you have a dispute with any third party with respect to any Virtual Currency transfer you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">5. Selling Virtual Currency</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>&quot;Sell&quot; Transaction.</strong> To initiate a “Sell” transaction, you will choose the amount of Virtual Currency you wish to sell to the Company from your Hosted Balance and tap “Sell”. In the event the “Sell” feature is available, the Company will then purchase such amount of Virtual Currency from you and deposit the value of Virtual Currency in your Cash App as Fiat Currency. The price you receive for any Virtual Currency sold to the Company may vary based on market factors, including the price and volume of the Virtual Currency you are attempting to sell.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>No Guarantee.</strong> The Company does not guarantee the availability of “Sell” transactions, or your ability to sell Virtual Currency held in your Hosted Balance. The act of selling Virtual Currency to the Company does not create a guarantee that you may sell Virtual Currency to the Company at a later time.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6. Peer to Peer Bitcoin Transfers</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may allow you to initiate peer-to-peer bitcoin transfers to other Cash App customers within the app (each transfer, a “P2P Bitcoin Transaction”). P2P Bitcoin Transactions are “off-chain” transactions facilitated by the Company. As such they are not broadcast to the bitcoin network and will not be reflected on the public ledger. All bitcoin transferred via P2P Bitcoin Transactions are custodied by the Company. P2P Bitcoin Transactions may only be completed between Virtual Currency Accounts; if you initiate a P2P Bitcoin Transaction to a Cash App Account that is not an Virtual Currency Account, the recipient must take the necessary steps to become an Virtual Currency Account before the transaction will be completed. If the recipient fails to open a Virtual Currency Account for any reason within the required period of time, the attempted P2P Bitcoin Transaction will be voided and the bitcoin returned to your account. Once you accept a P2P Bitcoin Transaction, any subsequent P2P Bitcoin Transaction to you will be automatically completed into your Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with P2P Bitcoin Transactions at any time subject to these Virtual Currency Terms. Any fees assessed will be reflected in app at or prior to your confirmation of the transaction.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may impose transaction limits on P2P Bitcoin Transactions in our sole discretion. Fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of Virtual Currency with no recourse. It is your responsibility to provide accurate instructions for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions, and the Company is not responsible for any P2P Bitcoin Transactions facilitated based on inaccurate or incomplete instructions. P2P Bitcoin Transactions occur in bitcoin denominations (i.e. “satoshis”). You may have the option to choose an estimated amount of a P2P Bitcoin Transaction denominated in dollars. Prior to sending any P2P Bitcoin Transaction you will be shown the amount of the transfer denominated in bitcoin; it is your responsibility to ensure that the transfer amount in bitcoin is correct. All estimated denominations of P2P Bitcoin Transactions in dollars are based on the then-effective Conversion Rate and are not a guarantee or promise of the amount of bitcoin that will be transferred. The value of bitcoin can fluctuate rapidly and the Company does not guarantee the dollar value of any P2P Bitcoin Transaction. Bitcoin received via P2P Bitcoin Transaction may lose value, and recipients will not be reimbursed for such losses.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7. Fees</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may charge fees for Virtual Currency transactions within Cash App, including any purchase, sale, transfer, or transaction on any Supported Network. For any transaction you initiate, you agree to pay the fees shown to you at or prior to you confirming the transaction. We may change the fees at any time, with or without notice to you.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">8. Conversion Rate</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You may buy or sell Virtual Currency through the Virtual Currency Services. Any such buy or sell transaction is subject to the Company “Conversion Rate” for the given transaction. “Conversion Rate” means the price of Virtual Currency in terms of Fiat Currency as displayed in the Cash App once you have selected “Buy” or “Sell” and such Conversion Rate is the price in terms of Fiat Currency at which you may buy Virtual Currency from or sell Virtual Currency to the Company. You acknowledge that the Company may add a margin or “spread” between the quoted mid market price displayed on the Virtual Currency dashboard and the quoted buy or sell price and, as such, that the quoted buy price Conversion Rate may not be the same as the sell price Conversion Rate at any given time. You agree, as a condition of buying or selling Virtual Currency through the Cash App, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric. You have no obligation to accept the offered buy or sell price for Virtual Currency in the Cash App.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">9. Risk Disclosure</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>GENERAL.</strong> VIRTUAL CURRENCY VALUES CAN FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY WHICH MAY RESULT IN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE VALUE OF THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY IN YOUR HOSTED BALANCE. THE SUPPLY OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY TO SELL TO YOU AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE OR TRANSFER YOUR VIRTUAL CURRENCY DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY ’S CONTROL, THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MAKES NO PROMISES AS TO TIMING OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY PURCHASES, SALES, AND TRANSFERS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT OWN OR CONTROL ANY OF THE SOFTWARE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE VIRTUAL CURRENCIES PURCHASED, SOLD, OR TRANSFERRED THROUGH THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO SUCH PROTOCOLS AND ANY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS IN VIRTUAL CURRENCY, AND MAKES NO GUARANTEES REGARDING THE SECURITY, FUNCTIONALITY OR AVAILABILITY OF SUCH PROTOCOLS.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>FORKS.</strong> BY USING THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS ARE SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES IN OPERATING RULES (KNOWN AS “FORKS”), AND THAT SUCH FORKS MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE VALUE, FUNCTION, AND/OR EVEN THE NAME OF THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY. IN THE EVENT OF A FORK, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OPERATIONS (WITH OR WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE TO YOU) AND THAT WE MAY, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SUPPORT (OR CEASE SUPPORTING) EITHER BRANCH OF THE FORKED PROTOCOL ENTIRELY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE COMPANY ASSUMES ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER IN RESPECT OF AN UNSUPPORTED BRANCH OF A FORKED PROTOCOL.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>SYSTEM FAILURE.</strong> YOU ACCEPT ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY SERVICES TO CONDUCT VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAILURE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, INTERNET CONNECTIONS, AND FAILURES RELATED TO ANY SUPPORTED NETWORK. THE NATURE OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY MEANS THAT ANY TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY MAY PREVENT THE ACCESS OR USE OF YOUR VIRTUAL CURRENCY.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Disruption Events.</strong> You agree that we are not liable for any price fluctuations in Virtual Currency. In the event of material market events or other prevailing circumstances, we may do one or more of the following: (a) suspend access to the Virtual Currency Services; or (b) prevent you from completing any actions via the Virtual Currency Services. We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from such actions. Following any such event, when Virtual Currency Services resume, you acknowledge that prevailing market rates, including the Conversion Rate, may differ significantly from the rates available prior to such event.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> Our responsibility is limited to the exercise of ordinary diligence in operating the Virtual Currency Services and giving access to your Virtual Currency and in preventing access to your Virtual Currency by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access or loss or harm an unauthorized access may cause, unless caused only by our gross negligence or our willful misconduct. You will have no claim against us for loss of your Virtual Currency unless you prove that the loss was not caused or contributed to by you.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Risks Inherent to Virtual Currency.</strong> (a) Virtual Currency transactions are irreversible, and, accordingly losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable and the Company shall not be held liable for any fraudulent or accidental transactions, (b) Virtual Currency is not legal tender and is not backed by a government or central bank. As such, there is no protection, such as deposit insurance, to cover any losses associated with Virtual Currency, (c) legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency or the functionality or availability of any Supported Network, (d) each Supported Network is maintained by a vast, unidentified private computer network spread around the world, and choosing to participate in Virtual Currency transactions on any Supported Network is at your own risk and based solely on your own understanding of the Virtual Currency and Supported Network, (e) Virtual Currency is a target for fraud and the potential for fraud is especially likely when you engage in transactions with External Virtual Currency Addresses, (f) Virtual Currency is a target for hackers and hacking can occur even when you use the strongest security settings and as such your Virtual Currency may be irretrievably stolen, (g) your bank accounts are at increased risk of being hacked when linked to Virtual Currency accounts, (h) some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you have initiated the transaction (i) the value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear, (j) there is no assurance that a person who accepts Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future, (k) the volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time, and (l) any bond or trust account held by the Company may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by our customers.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">10. Transaction History</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Transaction information will be reflected in your transaction history in the Cash App. You agree that failure to provide such confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of such transaction.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">11.

We may also make the purchase, sale, or transfer of Virtual Currency in the Cash App unavailable at any time, in our sole discretion. If the Virtual Currency Services are unavailable, any purchase, sale, or transfer requests you may have submitted for such Virtual Currency will be canceled.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Cancelations.</strong> You may not cancel any purchase, sale or transfer requests via the Virtual Currency Services.

You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to the exchanges made under the Virtual Currency Services. To the extent obligated by the relevant taxing authorities that we are required to deduct or withhold any amounts from payment, we will make the required payment net of such taxes. Any amounts so withheld will be treated as having been paid for all purposes of this agreement. You certify the information provided to the Company is accurate and consent to the Company using such information as is necessary to fulfill the Company&#x27;s federal, state and local tax payment or withholding purposes and tax filing obligations.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Currency Availability.</strong> The Company retains the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the types of Virtual Currency that may be available through the Virtual Currency Services, and may add or remove the availability of any Virtual Currency from the Virtual Currency Services at any time for any reason. The Company will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the likely removal of a Virtual Currency. If the market for a Virtual Currency is closed on the Cash App, you will have 30 days to transfer the amounts remaining in your Virtual Currency Account associated with such Virtual Currency to an External Virtual Currency Address. Any Virtual Currency that is no longer supported within the Cash App, and is not withdrawn within 30 days, will not be discarded; however, you must reach out to Support to arrange withdrawal. The Company will not be liable to you for any losses, liability or expenses related to the removal of a Virtual Currency.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>Independent Relationship.</strong> You agree that: (a) we are not acting as your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor, or in any fiduciary capacity, and (b) no communication or information provided to you by us shall be considered or construed as advice.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">12.

If we exercise our rights to limit or refuse your access to the Virtual Currency Services, we will not be responsible for any consequences of our refusal to give you access to the Virtual Currency Services, including any delay, damage or inconvenience you may suffer as a result.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Suspension, Termination, Discontinuance of your Virtual Currency Account.</strong> Without limiting other provisions in these Cash App Terms, we may suspend or terminate your Virtual Currency Account or your access to any of the Virtual Currency Services at any time in our sole discretion.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Suspension, Termination, Reversal of Transactions.</strong> We may suspend, refuse, freeze, decline, delay, redirect or reverse any transaction request, including purchase, sale, or transfer requests, for any reason, even after funds or Virtual Currency has been credited to your Virtual Currency Account, including for suspected fraud or illegal activity, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if we believe that the transaction is erroneous.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Access to Virtual Currency upon Termination.</strong> You will be permitted to transfer your Virtual Currency or USD funds held in your Virtual Currency Account for ninety (90) days after your access to the Virtual Currency Services have been deactivated or canceled, unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, including but not limited to applicable sanctions programs, or (ii) by a subpoena or court order.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">13. Bitcoin Boost Program</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Company may offer a bitcoin boost for eligible Cash Card holders (the “Bitcoin Boost”). If you have activated a Bitcoin Boost, for any eligible transaction on the Cash Card during the period of time when the Bitcoin Boost is active, you will receive the applicable boost percentage of the transaction amount (e.g. 1%) in Fiat Currency from the Company, up to any applicable maximum total boost amount (the “Boost Funds”). The Boost Funds will then automatically be used for a Buy in an amount equal to the Boost Funds, and such purchased bitcoin will be deposited in your holdings. By activating any Bitcoin Boost, you authorize and instruct the Company to place a Buy in the amount of the Boost Funds (each, a “Boost Buy”). No fees will apply to Boost Buys. Boost Buys will be placed as market orders on the applicable day and will be executed at the then-effective Conversion Rate. You may not receive prior notification of Boost Buys before they occur. There may be delays in the time between the eligible Cash Card transaction and the Boost Buy, during which time the Conversion Rate may have changed. Boost Buys are subject to available bitcoin inventory. Bitcoin may lose value. You may end up with bitcoin of lower value than the original Boost Funds, and any such loss of value will not be replaced. The Company may set restrictions on when Bitcoin Boosts are available, the amount and percentage of Bitcoin Boosts, and other eligibility and program criteria. You may inactivate a Bitcoin Boost at any time in Cash App. The Company may cancel or modify any Boost Buy for any reason in its sole discretion.

Virtual Currency Custom Orders</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Virtual Currency Custom Order (“<strong>VC Custom Order</strong>”) feature allows you to set a trading price (the “<strong>Trigger Price</strong>”) that will result in a Virtual Currency Buy or Sell to be placed upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event (defined below).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">To initiate a VC Custom Order, you will: (1) set the Trigger Price; (2) select the amount of bitcoin to Buy or Sell; and (3) select an expiration period. The VC Custom Order will expire if the Trigger Price is not reached before the end of the expiration period. You will be presented with a confirmation page prior to submitting the VC Custom Order instructions that will specify details about the VC Custom Order including any applicable fees.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you initiate your VC Custom Order, we will pull funds in the amount of the VC Custom Order, including any applicable fees, either (i) from your Cash App Balance in the case of a “Buy,” or (ii) from your Hosted Balance in the case of a “Sell.” If you initiate a VC Custom Order “Buy” in an amount that exceeds your current Cash App Balance, you authorize us to Add Cash to your Cash App Balance from an External Account or as otherwise permissible under the Cash App Terms, in an amount sufficient to cover your VC Custom Order and any applicable fees. You may not initiate a VC Custom Order “Sell” in an amount that exceeds your current Hosted Balance.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Only in the event that the Conversion Rate matches the Trigger Price (the “<strong>Trigger Event</strong>”) will the contingent Buy or Sell transaction associated with your VC Custom Order execute. By initiating a VC Custom Order, you authorize the Company to place a Buy or Sell, as applicable, in the amount specified in the VC Custom Order upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event. The Trigger Event is based exclusively on the Conversion Rate, and we will determine when the Trigger Price is reached in our sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the Conversion Rate is the sole metric used for purposes of determining whether the Trigger Event has occurred, and prices for Virtual Currency on other third party exchanges, markets, or otherwise are not considered or binding. Notwithstanding any prohibition on cancelations that may apply to the Virtual Currency Services in general, you may cancel your VC Custom Order at any time prior to the occurrence of the Trigger Event. We may cancel or modify any outstanding VC Custom Order at any time without notice to you, in our sole discretion. During the time that your VC Custom Order is pending and prior to its cancelation, expiration, or the occurrence of the Trigger Event, the funds or Virtual Currency used to place the VC Custom Order will not appear in your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. If your VC Custom Order is canceled or expires, the funds or Virtual Currency, together with any fees, will be returned to your Cash App Balance or Hosted Balance, as applicable. We will not be liable to you for any loss incurred as a result of the cancelation of your VC Custom Order.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">VC Custom Orders are an advanced order type; you should understand the risks of Virtual Currency transactions generally, and of placing advanced orders specifically, before placing a VC Custom Order. If you choose to place a VC Custom Order, you agree you do so at your own risk. Any outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability more broadly (including as a result of a service interruption caused by a third party) may impact the time that you are able to initiate or cancel your VC Custom Order. We will not be liable to you in the event that you are not able to place or cancel your VC Custom Order as a result of such outage or interruption to Cash App’s service availability. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any VC Custom Order.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">15. Virtual Currency Gifting</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may permit you to send or receive a Virtual Currency-denominated gift to or from other Cash App users, respectively, or to receive such a gift from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction (each, a “<strong>Virtual Currency Gift</strong>”). When initiating a Virtual Currency Gift transaction, the sender does not, in fact, transfer Virtual Currency to the recipient. Rather, the sender of a Virtual Currency Gift is sending Fiat Currency to the recipient via Cash App’s Peer-to-Peer Service, using the Cash App Balance held by the sender, and Cash App will prompt the recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift to complete a Buy order to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received from the sender.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift has no obligation to purchase Virtual Currency with the Fiat Currency received. The recipient may decline to make a purchase of Virtual Currency. If the recipient fails to accept the Virtual Currency Gift, whether to purchase Virtual Currency or to receive as Fiat Currency, within within 21 days of receiving a Virtual Currency Gift, then (i) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from another Cash App user, the gifted funds will be returned as Fiat Currency to the sender’s Cash App Balance, and (ii) in the case of a Virtual Currency Gift received from us as part of a promotional marketing interaction, the gifted funds will be returned to us. The recipient is solely responsible for submitting a Buy order to acquire Virtual Currency using the Fiat Currency received via the Virtual Currency Gift, and such Buy order is entirely at the direction and instruction of the recipient.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You acknowledge that the value of Virtual Currency at the time a sender initiates a Virtual Currency Gift may be higher or lower, relative to Fiat Currency, than the value of Virtual Currency at the time a recipient of a Virtual Currency Gift chooses to accept such gift and place a Virtual Currency Buy order. Moreover, Virtual Currency purchased by the recipient, as a result of a Virtual Currency Gift, may lose value, and any lost value will not be reimbursed or replaced by us. Purchasing bitcoin is a risky activity and may involve loss. Please carefully review the Virtual Currency risk disclosures before placing any Virtual Currency Order. Following the receipt of a Virtual Currency Gift and the placement of a subsequent Buy order of Virtual Currency, a recipient will have to sell its Virtual Currency in order to receive any Fiat Currency. Selling Virtual Currency may have tax implications, and we will not provide any reimbursement or compensation for the tax consequences of selling Virtual Currency. If you have questions about your particular tax situation, you should consult a tax advisor.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">16. Sponsored Accounts</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. <strong>Authorization</strong>. You may enable use of Virtual Currency Services for Sponsored Accounts, provided your Account is authorized for Virtual Currency Services.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. <strong>Ownership and Responsibility</strong>. You, and not the Sponsored Account, are the owner of any Virtual Currency held in a Sponsored Account, and all assets or liabilities related to Virtual Currency held by the Sponsored Account are yours and not the Sponsored Person’s. You will be responsible for any losses incurred by a Sponsored Account, and Cash App will not reimburse or otherwise remedy any losses incurred or caused by a Sponsored Account. You are responsible in full for the use of the Sponsored Account, including any obligations or liabilities incurred by it. You are responsible for any tax consequences of the use of Virtual Currency Services by the Sponsored Account. Upon the sale of any Virtual Currency, the proceeds of such sale will be owned by the Sponsored Account, and not you.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. <strong>Authorization</strong>. If enabled by you to use Virtual Currency Services, the Sponsored Account will be allowed to transact in Virtual Currency in the same manner as your Account, though subject to certain limits (see below for more detail). By enabling Virtual Currency Services for a Sponsored Account, you authorize, consent to, and approve of the Sponsored Person having general discretionary control of the Virtual Currency in the Sponsored Account, including the ability to sell the Virtual Currency. The Sponsored Account will be able to access, transact in, and buy and sell Virtual Currency without prior approval from, or notice to, you. Only the Sponsored Person may be able to access or transact using the Sponsored Account; you may not be permitted to make any transactions in the Sponsored Account (aside from requesting that the Sponsored Account be closed or liquidated). The Sponsored Person’s actions with respect to the Sponsored Account will have the same force and effect as if you had done them yourself, and therefore we are allowed to rely on any instruction to us by the Sponsored Person regarding the Sponsored Account. You understand and acknowledge that all actions taken, including the trades placed by the Sponsored Person are at your own risk. You are able to revoke this authorization at any time either in-app or by contacting us.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. <strong>Supervision</strong>. You are responsible for the activity of any Sponsored Account, including for any losses that may be incurred and for ensuring that activity in the Sponsored Account complies with these Cash App Terms. It is your responsibility to promptly review the Sponsored Account’s activity and to contact us immediately in the event that you have any questions or concerns. It is your responsibility to take action, either in-app or by contacting us, to suspend or revoke a Sponsored Person’s access to a Sponsored Account. We will not monitor or supervise the Sponsored Account’s activity.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">e. <strong>Unilateral Graduation and Transfer of Assets</strong>. Once the Sponsored Person reaches the age of majority we will help them transition the holdings of the Sponsored Account. Upon the Sponsored Person reaching the age of majority in their state of residence they will be able to transfer title, custody, and ownership of the assets of the respective Sponsored Account. You authorize and consent to us transferring the respective Sponsored Account assets at the direction of the Sponsored Person upon their reaching the age of majority.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">f. <strong>Limits</strong>. Sponsored Accounts may not have access to all Virtual Currency Services, and may be subject to specific transaction or activity limits. A Sponsored Person may not be able to transfer assets out of the Sponsored Account. Transfers of Virtual Currency into and out of Sponsored Accounts may be limited or outright prohibited. If we determine we need to close a Sponsored Account, any holdings in such Sponsored Account may be liquidated and the account closed. We reserve the right to impose any additional limits or restrictions on Sponsored Accounts at any time in our sole discretion.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">g. <strong>Life Events</strong>. You agree to notify us promptly of any life event or change in circumstance that impacts your or the Sponsored Person’s ability to own or use a Sponsored Account. You will notify us if there is a change in your relationship to the Sponsored Person that would affect the ability of you or the Sponsored Person to perform their obligations under this Agreement. We will work with you and the Sponsored Person to transition the account to another sponsor or close the account, as necessary.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">h. <strong>Taxes</strong>. As you are the owner of the Sponsored Account you are responsible for any tax consequences of the Sponsored Account’s activity and holdings. You should consult a tax advisor regarding the federal, state, and local tax consequences of opening a Sponsored Account with respect to your and the Sponsored Person.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">X.

Stock Gifting</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may permit you to send a “Gift” of stock to another person (the “Recipient”). When you send a Gift of stock, you are sending an amount of Fiat Currency that the Recipient may use to initiate a self-directed purchase of the stock you identified in the Gift. The Recipient may decline to make a self-directed purchase of the stock and instead accept the Gift as cash.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you send a Gift, the Gift is not a security and the Recipient is not receiving anything other than Fiat Currency. Cash App Investing is an entirely self-directed brokerage service and accountholders are solely responsible for trades placed in their accounts. Any trade placed to acquire stock with the Gift is entirely at the direction and instruction of the Recipient.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">To receive a Gift, the Recipient must have a Cash App account. To use the Gift to purchase stock, the Recipient must successfully open a Cash App Investing brokerage account.

If the Recipient does not agree to the Cash App Investing Terms or is unable to successfully open a Cash App Investing brokerage account, the Recipient cannot open a Cash App Investing Account and will not be able to use the Gift to purchase stock. If the Recipient does not accept the Gift within twenty-one (21) calendar days, the Gift will be returned to you.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When sending a Gift, the particular stock you identify in connection with the Gift is chosen at your discretion. Neither the Gift nor the stock identified in connection with the Gift constitute a recommendation by Cash App Investing to buy or sell any security or asset. Cash App Investing does not make recommendations or provide investment advice.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Investing is a risky activity and may involve loss. The amount of stock purchased by the Recipient using the Gift, if any, may lose value, and any lost value will not be reimbursed or replaced by Cash App or Cash App Investing. Further, the stock’s price may change after you send the Gift but before the Recipient uses it to make a self-directed purchase of the stock you identified. Selling shares may have tax implications, and neither Cash App nor Cash App Investing will provide any reimbursement or compensation for the tax consequences of selling any stock purchased using a Gift.

Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (“Notice”). Any Notice to the Company should be sent by mail to Block, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may elect, in writing sent to the other party, that it will pursue the matter either through small claims court or arbitration. The party receiving the notice shall then have seven (7) days to respond, including to elect for the case to be heard by a small claims court with jurisdiction. If either party elects small claims court, the dispute will be resolved in that forum and not through arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Scope of Arbitration.</strong> If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer Rules.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> through the Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (the “Desk/Documents Only” arbitration) (the “AAA Rules”), including Rule D-3(b), except you and the Company will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and so long as the claim is arbitrable under the AAA Rules. Except as set forth above, and for disputes subject to jurisdiction in small claims court, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Cash App Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA but before an arbitrator has been selected, the other party can send a written notice to the opposing party that it wants the Dispute decided by a small claims court. After receiving this notice and consistent with Consumer Rule 9, the AAA will administratively close the case.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies. So long as it is consistent with the AAA Rules, including Rule D-3(b), the arbitration shall occur through the submission of documents to one arbitrator. To the extent any in-person arbitration hearing is required, the arbitration hearing will take place as close to your hometown as practicable. The Arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Company values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim. The Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Arbitration Fees.</strong> In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee.

You should not assume that an Electronic Check will be accepted for Mobile Check Capture. If you need to cash a check immediately, then you should have backup check cashing options for situations where Mobile Check Capture does not accept your check.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">After we have accepted an Electronic Check from you, you must keep the original check in a secure location for two weeks.

Dishonored Electronic Checks</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If any Electronic Check is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, including because we determine the Electronic Check is fraudulent, then we may immediately (and without further notice to you) deduct any funds from the Electronic Check that we have credited to your Cash App Balance. If we have already made funds from the Electronic Check available to you then this deduction may result in a negative Cash App Balance. We may recover funds from you in accordance with the Recovery of Funds section of the Cash App Terms to bring your negative balance to zero.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6.

Some common problems, but not all, are listed here. If we make the bank that accepts your check whole, then we may recover funds from you.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Pursuant to applicable law and the rules of the check collection system, the drawee bank or a collecting bank might pursue a warranty claim or other claim against us related to the Electronic Check, even after the check was honored and paid in full. Common grounds for claims like this include:</p><ul><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The original check, or another electronic check created from the original check, was presented for payment, either before or after the drawee bank paid the Electronic Check;</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The maker’s signature or any indorsement was forged, or the check was otherwise issued fraudulent and without the authorization of a person authorized to write checks on the account;</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The check was altered after it was made; and</p></li><li><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The information in the Electronic Check images did not match the information that you provided at the time that you submitted the Electronic Check, or it was not possible to verify that information because the information in the Electronic Check images was illegible.</p></li></ul><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">These are just a few examples of the reasons that the drawee bank or a collecting bank may assert a claim with respect to the Electronic Check to recover amounts paid. If we (or one of our banks or other service providers) are subject to such a claim, then we may immediately recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds (and without notice to you).</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7.

If you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check before 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a business day, we will consider the Electronic Check to have been Successfully Submitted on that day. However, if you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check after 7:00 pm Eastern Time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider that the Electronic Check was Successfully Submitted on the next business day. Funds from a U.S. Treasury check will generally be available the first business day after you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, unless such deposit is subject to a hold as otherwise provided in this agreement.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Checks other than U.S. Treasury checks are subject to a hold period between 1 and 15 business days.</p><h6>Checks Returned or Subject to a Refund Claim</h6><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may make funds available to you before they clear from the paying bank. If we do, and the funds do not clear the paying bank you will be required to pay back the funds we made available to you. If you present us with a check that has been paid out by another bank and we also make funds available to you, you will be required to repay the funds to us.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In many cases, funds from an Electronic Check will be made available to you sooner than the Electronic Check can be collected from the paying bank. This means that an Electronic Check that you Successfully Submit with Mobile Check Capture could be returned unpaid after funds have been made available to you. If an Electronic Check is returned unpaid, we may immediately reverse the amount credited to your Cash App Balance for the Electronic Check. If this results in a negative balance, then you will be required to repay us this negative balance immediately. We may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If an Electronic Check is presented for payment more than once, the paying bank may recover funds paid on the Electronic Check. If this happens, we may deduct the amount of the Electronic Check from your Cash App Balance immediately. If this results in a negative balance, you will be required to repay the negative balance immediately, and we may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">8.

Remittance Service</h4><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">1. Description of the Service</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Remittance Service allows you to send Remittance Payments (defined below) from the United States to individuals in certain other countries for personal, non-commercial purposes (the “Remittance Service”).</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">2. Sending Remittance Payments</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. General. eligible Unrestricted Accounts will be able to use the Remittance Service. As Sender, you will provide instructions to transfer funds (the “Remittance Payment Instructions”), including but not limited to instructions about the amount to be paid, the currency to be paid out, the method of payout (including information about the recipient’s bank, such as the routing number, or the name and country of the payout agent), the identity of the person to be paid (the “Designated Recipient”), and other information. You may only use the Remittance Service using funds in your Cash App Balance. If you have a Restricted Account, you will be prohibited from using the Remittance Service.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. Authorization. By initiating each Remittance Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your Cash App Balance by the amount you specify, including Cash App’s associated fees and any applicable taxes, and to send those funds to your Designated Recipient (a “Remittance Payment(s)”) immediately upon your request and selected delivery method. By submitting an Remittance Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your Cash App Balance for Remittance Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">c. Processing Timeframe. Subject to the 30-minute cancellation procedures discussed below, you understand and agree that when you initiate a Remittance Payment, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Cash App Balance as early as the moment you initiate the Remittance Payment.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If Cash App executes a Remittance Payment for you pursuant to your Remittance Payment Instruction and there aren’t sufficient funds in your Account to cover the transfer, you understand that Block’s recovery of these funds may cause your account to become negative.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">d. Method of Payout. As part of the Remittance Payment Instruction, Sender must select a delivery method for the Remittance Payment. The Sender may select either (1) cash pickup at a paying agent location we have partnered with or (2) deposit into the Designated Recipient’s bank account in the destination country.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">3. Cancellations and Refunds</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Within 30 minutes of your Remittance Payment, you have the right to cancel for a full refund, including fees, unless the recipient has already picked up the money or the funds have been deposited into the recipient’s account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">a. 30-Minute Cancellation and Right to Refund</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You have the right to cancel a Remittance Payment and obtain a refund of all funds paid to us, including fees. In order to cancel, you must contact us by either calling 1-800-969-1940 or by contacting us through your Account in the app within 30 minutes of payment for the transfer (the “Cancellation Period”).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When you contact us, you must provide us with information to help us identify the transfer you wish to cancel, including the amount and the location where the funds were sent. We will refund your money within 3 business days of your cancellation request as long as the funds have not already been picked up or deposited into the Designated Recipient’s bank account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">b. Automatic Cancellations and Refunds</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Subject to applicable law, if Sender selects cash pickup as the delivery method for a Remittance Payment and the Designated Recipient either fails to pick up the money transfer or fails to sufficiently verify their identity as required within 21 days after the available pickup date provided on the Sender’s receipt, the money transfer will be canceled automatically. Such identity verification requirements may include, but are not limited to, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering compliance review.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">For any canceled Remittance Payment, we will refund you and return to you any unclaimed, refused, refunded, or denied Remittance Payment to your Cash App Balance unless we are prohibited from doing so under law. If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the Remittance Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law. All refunds will be in USD. All refunds will be processed within thirty (30) days of the date of cancellation.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">4. Remittance Service Fees</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will be charged certain fees in connection with your use of the Remittance Service.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The fees for using the Remittance Service are found in Section I. “Stored Balance Disclosures“ of the Cash App Terms and will be disclosed in-app prior to your submission of a Remittance Payment Instruction. We reserve the right to change the fees associated with use of the Remittance Service at any time with reasonable notice, subject to these Cash App Terms and applicable law.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">5. Currency Exchange Rate</h5><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Cash App may make money on the exchange rate applied to your transaction.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">All Remittance Payments will be funded in United States dollars (“USD”) and paid to the Designated Recipient in the official currency of the destination country. In some countries and subject to availability, you may be able to choose a payout currency other than the official local currency. Subject to applicable law, we disclose the actual exchange rate or an estimated exchange rate that applies to your transaction before you submit payment for the transaction and on your receipt. If the Remittance Payment involves an exchange of currencies, the retail exchange rate we quote for individual senders may be different from the wholesale exchange rate we obtain in commercial transactions with our foreign exchange providers. The difference between the retail exchange rate applied to your Remittance Payment and the wholesale exchange rate at which we acquired the payout currency will be kept by Cash App and/or the paying agent as revenue, in addition to any fees disclosed on your receipt or in Section I. Cash App’s paying agent must pay out money transfers in the payout currency indicated on your receipt.</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">6. Payment and Transaction Limits</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may limit, prohibit, or require you to provide us with additional identification information based on the number of Remittance Payments you send over any period of time. We may also impose other limits, including but not limited to, on the amount you can send in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any period of time and/or to certain countries, subject to some restrictions. We may adjust these limits at any time at our discretion subject to applicable laws</p><h5 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h5__jIdfZ product-page-heading-text_medium__HPOE_">7. Risk of Fraudulent Transactions</h5><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Be on the lookout for fraud. While we make efforts to identify and reduce the impact of fraudulent scams on our customers, sometimes, scammers are successful. The Remittance Service is a money transmission service. As a result, please be aware and vigilant that fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of your funds with no recourse.</p></div></div></div></div><nav

If the Remittance Payment involves an exchange of currencies, the retail exchange rate we quote for individual senders may be different from the wholesale exchange rate we obtain in commercial transactions with our foreign exchange providers. The difference between the retail exchange rate applied to your Remittance Payment and the wholesale exchange rate at which we acquired the payout currency will be kept by Cash App and/or the paying agent as revenue, in addition to any fees disclosed on your receipt or in Section I. Cash App’s paying agent must pay out money transfers in the payout currency indicated on your receipt.","marks":[],"data":{}}]},{"nodeType":"heading-5","data":{},"content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"6.
