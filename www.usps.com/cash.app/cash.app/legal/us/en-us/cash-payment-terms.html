class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We’ve included annotations in the gray boxes below to emphasize certain portions of our terms and help guide you as you read them. The annotations aren’t summaries, so please take the time to read everything!</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">This page explains our terms for payment processing. By using the service you agree to these terms. If you use our services on behalf of your company, that company agrees to them too.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">By using Block, Inc. (formerly known as &quot;Square, Inc.&quot;) (hereafter, “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) payment processing services (“Payment Services”), you agree to be bound by the Cash App Terms of Service (“Cash App Terms”), these additional terms and conditions (“Payment Terms”) and all other terms, policies and guidelines applicable to the Services (as defined in the Cash App Terms) used. If you are using the Payment Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms and you represent to us that you have authority to bind that business or entity to these terms. Payment Services may only be used for business purposes in the fifty states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia. Defined terms will have the same meaning as those found in the Cash App Terms, unless otherwise re-defined herein.</p><h3 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h3__LQpME"><strong>I. Payment Services</strong></h3><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>1. Our Role</strong><br/>Our Payment Service lets you accept payments from other Cash App customers for your goods or services. You acknowledge and agree you will not use your Cash for Business Account for receiving funds for personal, non commercial purposes.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>2. Card Acceptance</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Our service lets you take major card brand payments from your customers. We aren’t a bank, and to make it work we partner with card brands and banks that help process card payments.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you take a lot of payments, the card brands might require that you also enter into an agreement directly with them, called a “Commercial Entity Agreement”.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Company is a payment facilitator that allows you to accept Cards (defined below) from customers for the payment for goods and services. We are not a bank and do not offer banking services. Our Payment Services allow you to accept payments from any US-issued and most non-US issued credit, debit, prepaid, or gift cards (“Cards”) bearing the trademarks of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (“American Express”), DFS Services, LLC (“Discover”), MasterCard International Inc. (“MasterCard”) and Visa Inc. (“Visa”) (collectively, the “Networks”). You are not required to accept any card brand as a condition of receiving the Payment Services. We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice.<br/>In order to serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Networks, processors and acquiring banks. The Networks require that any person that signs up for a Cash for Business Account to use Payment Services (a “Seller”) and processes more than Network specified amounts of Cards sales enter into an agreement directly with the Company&#x27;s acquiring banks. By accepting or otherwise agreeing to these Payment Terms, you agree to the terms and conditions of the applicable “Commercial Entity Agreement” effective as of the date you process such specified amounts or as otherwise required by the Company&#x27;s acquiring banks. If you fail to agree to any “Commercial Entity Agreement”, we may suspend or terminate your Cash for Business Account. Similarly, if American Express considers you to be a high value customer, it may require that you maintain your agreement directly with American Express and designate the Company as your agent for American Express payments.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>3. Your Authorization for Settlement of Proceeds and for the Company to Recover Funds</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You authorize us to act as your agent for payment processing, which includes holding, receiving, and disbursing funds for you. You also authorize us to recover funds from you when needed.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In connection with the Payment Services, you authorize us to act as your agent for the purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to settle the proceeds of each payment you receive, less any applicable fees (“Proceeds”). Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until the later of closure or termination of your Cash for Business Account, or the disbursement of all funds held on your behalf. Our receipt of transaction funds satisfies your customer’s obligations to make payment to you. We will remit to you funds actually received by us on your behalf, less amounts owed to us, subject to any Chargeback provisions (as defined in Sections 10-13).<br/>In addition, by using the Payment Services, you authorize us to recover funds from you in accordance with these Payment Terms, Section XI.1 of the Cash App Terms and any other agreement you have with us (“Recovery Authorizations”).<br/><br/><strong>4. Unsupported Industries</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We can’t process payments for certain types of businesses or business activity, because of limitations from the card brands, our bank partners, or the law. A few types we won’t support for other business reasons.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Except where prohibited by law, you may not use the Payment Services for the following businesses or business activities: (1) any illegal activity or goods, (2) paraphernalia that may be used for illegal activity (3) buyers or membership clubs, including dues associated with such clubs, (4) credit counseling or credit repair agencies, (5) credit protection or identity theft protection services, (6) direct marketing or subscription offers or services, (7) infomercial sales, (8) internet/mail order/telephone order pharmacies or pharmacy referral services (where fulfillment of medication is performed with an internet or telephone consultation, absent a physical visit, including re-importation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries), (9) unauthorized multi-level marketing businesses, (10) inbound or outbound telemarketers, (11) prepaid phone cards or phone services, (12) rebate based businesses, (13) up-sell merchants, (14) bill payment services, (15) betting, including lottery tickets, sports related gambling, casino gaming chips, off-track betting, and wagers at races, (16) manual or automated cash disbursements, (17) prepaid cards, checks, insurance or other financial merchandise or services, (18) sales of money-orders or foreign currency, (19) wire transfer money orders, (20) high-risk products and services, including telemarketing sales, (21) automated fuel dispensers, (22) adult entertainment oriented products or services (in any medium, including internet, telephone, or printed material), (23) sales of (i) firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or (ii) weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury (24) internet/mail order/telephone order of age restricted products (e.g., tobacco), (25) occult materials, (26) hate or harmful products, (27) escort services, (28) bankruptcy attorneys or collection agencies engaged in the collection of debt; (29) if you are a local, state, or federal government entity, (30) collecting funds for political contributions (including but not limited to campaign-related donations or funds to support the operations of a political action committee, political party, or candidate), or (31) taking donations if you are a non-profit entity that regularly does business in California or holds property for charitable purposes in California.<br/><strong><br/>5. Our Fees</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may charge a fee when you receive a payment. We may need to change our fees from time to time, and we’ll let you know in advance when we do.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You agree to pay the applicable fees disclosed to you when you create your Cash for Business Account. All fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds. Subject to the Cash App Terms and these Payment Terms, we reserve the right to change the fees upon reasonable advance notice. All Balances and all fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in US dollars.<br/><strong><br/>6. Requests for Additional Information and Inspection</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We may ask you for more information about you or your business. If you refuse, we might need to shut down your Cash for Business Account.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Company may request additional information from you at any time. For example, the Company may ask you to present invoices from your suppliers, a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a business license, or other information. the Company may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. If you refuse any of these requests, your Cash for Business Account may be suspended or terminated.<br/><strong><br/>7. Cash for Business Account History</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Your Cash for Business Account logs your transactions processed with the Company. You are responsible for your own record-keeping, and if you think there’s an error or unauthorized activity, you should let us know immediately.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When a payment is made to your Cash for Business Account, it will be reflected in your Cash App activity feed. Summaries of your Cash for Business activity, including monthly statements, are available through the app or on the Cash website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Cash for Business Account and your use of the Payment Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Cash for Business Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Cash for Business Account, you must contact us immediately.<br/><strong><br/>8. Cash for Business Account Balances</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We safeguard merchant funds, including yours, in pooled bank accounts on your and other merchants’ behalf. You do not earn interest on funds we hold for you.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">While you have funds in your Cash for Business Account (your “Balance”), your Balance will be commingled and held with other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and others holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”). We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any pooled account. We will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you. As consideration for using the Payment Services, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Balance in a Pooled Account.</p><h3 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h3__LQpME"><strong>II. Chargebacks</strong></h3><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>1. Your Liability for Chargebacks</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Chargebacks happen when your customers or cardholders dispute transactions with your business. You are responsible for chargebacks to your account and for following our chargeback resolution processes.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">There may be times when your customer may not be the authorized user of the Card or your customer may otherwise contest the transaction. In these instances, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Cash for Business Account (a “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a customer or its financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the Cash App Terms or these Payment Terms. You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to the liability associated with such Chargebacks.<br/><strong><br/>2. Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you have pending chargebacks, we may delay payouts to you. If you lose a chargeback, you agree to pay us the full amount plus any fees, and that we can debit your linked bank account to recover money you owe.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You grant us Recovery Authorizations concerning Chargebacks pursuant to which we may recover the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by a Network or our processor. Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time that (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer complaint, in which case we will retain the funds, (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which your customer may dispute that the transaction has expired, or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.<br/><strong><br/>3. Excessive Chargebacks</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you have - or if we think you are likely to have - too many chargebacks we may add restrictions to your account.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your Cash for Business Account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) delaying payouts, or (c) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.<br/><strong><br/>4. Contesting Chargebacks</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Chargebacks are time sensitive and can involve many parties (you, your bank, your customer, their bank, card brands, etc.), so we need your help to contest chargebacks quickly and diligently. If a chargeback doesn’t end in your favor, we have the right to collect the chargeback amount and any related fees from your account.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Payment Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the customer, the customer’s financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. We may also use any Content you upload through the Services to respond to Chargebacks on your behalf. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.</p><h3 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h3__LQpME"><strong>III.

You will not use the Payment Services to handle, process or transmit funds for any third party. You also may not use the Payment Services to process cash advances.<br/><strong><br/>2. Unauthorized or Illegal Use</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Don’t try to process illegal or unauthorized transactions. We might decline a transaction if we think it violates our terms or may harm you, your customers, or us. You agree we can share your information with law enforcement to protect ourselves or our partners.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will only accept payments for transactions that are allowed by applicable law. We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in violation of these Payment Terms or any other agreement with the Company, or that it exposes you, your customers, other Sellers, our processors or the Company to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we suspect that your Cash for Business Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Cash for Business Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement and, as deemed necessary by the Company, our payment processing and financial institution partners, in accordance with applicable state, local, and federal laws and regulations governing such information sharing.<br/><strong><br/>3. Applicable Network Rules</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You agree to follow merchant rules published by the card brands, like Visa, MasterCard and American Express.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">By using the Payment Services, you agree to comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations set forth by the Networks (“Network Rules”). The Networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. The Company may be required to change these terms in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://visa.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://visa.com</a>, <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://www.mastercard.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.mastercard.com</a>, and <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://www.americanexpress.com/merchantopguide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.americanexpress.com/merchantopguide</a>. In the event of inconsistency between a Network Rule and these Payment Terms, and except as otherwise agreed between the Company and the Network, the Network Rule shall apply. You also agree to be bound by any applicable NACHA Rules.<br/><strong><br/>4. Taxes</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If we notice that you process payments above IRS reporting limits, we’re required by law to report that information about you to the IRS.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason for your use of the Payment Services (“Taxes”). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. The Company specifically disclaims any liability for Taxes. If in a given calendar year you process (i) more than the applicable reporting threshold according to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and/or state and local governments in gross amount of payments and/or (ii) more than the applicable number of payments threshold according to the IRS and/or state and local governments, the Company will be required by law to report information about you and your use of the Payment Services to the IRS. For purposes of determining whether you have met the IRS and/or state and local government reporting threshold, the gross amount does not include any adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts or any other amounts. Whether you reach the applicable gross amount in payments or more than the applicable number of payments, this will be determined by looking at the taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) you provide as part of your Account Information when you open, switch, or use your Cash for Business Account.<br/>For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to the Company under these Cash App Terms shall be paid free and clear of any deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than taxes that may be charged by the Company to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by law shall be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant taxation authority.<br/>You may be asked to provide certain information used to assist the Company in complying with its obligations under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations, or state and local governments. By providing the Company with this information you are certifying that the information provided is true and accurately reflective of your use of the Services.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">When indicating that you are a Cash for Business Seller, you certify that your use of Payment Services through Cash App is to receive payment(s) that are “reportable payment transactions” as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.6050W–1(a)(3) and the associated applicable state and local regulations, including, but not limited to, the payments for goods and services.<br/><strong><br/>5. Network Logos and Marks</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Don’t abuse card brand logos and marks.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Your use of Network logos and marks (“Network Marks”) is governed by the Network Rules; you must familiarize yourself with and comply with these requirements. The Networks are the sole and exclusive owners of their respective Network Marks. You will not contest the ownership of the Network Marks, and any Network may prohibit you from using its Network Marks for any reason and at any time. The Company may require you to make modifications to your Website or other advertising and signage in order to comply with Network Rules related to the Network Marks.<br/><br/><strong>6. Failure to Comply with Network Rules</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Complying with card brand rules helps us make sure your transactions are safe and secure. Keep your passwords safe, don’t give the wrong people access to your account, and don’t expose your customers’ card information. If you fail to do so, you’re responsible for losses we suffer.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Notwithstanding Section 24 of these terms or the Indemnity Section of the Cash App Terms, you understand that your failure to comply with the Network Rules may result in fines or other losses to the Company. You will indemnify us and reimburse us immediately for any fines or losses directly or indirectly caused by your and your agents’ actions.</p><h3 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h3__LQpME"><strong>IV. Your Additional Obligations</strong></h3><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>1. Receipts</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You need to offer a receipt for transactions greater than $15, and you need to request that customers sign for transactions greater than $25.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You will request that your customer personally sign for all transactions greater than $25 when your customer is present. You must make a written receipt available to your customers for any transaction greater than $15. You may give your customers the option to receive or decline a written receipt.<br/><strong><br/>2. Receipts for 501(c)(3) Organizations</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you’re a non-profit, you should know that not all payments to your organization are tax-deductible contributions. You’re responsible for how you classify your transactions.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you operate a 501(c)(3) organization, you acknowledge that not all payments made to your organization may be eligible for classification as “tax deductible to the extent allowed by law,” and you assume full responsibility for the classification of your transactions. The Company specifically disclaims any liability in this regard.<br/><strong><br/>3. Customer Service</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Customer service for your business is your responsibility. We provide customer service to you for the payment services you use.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You are solely responsible for all customer service policies and issues relating to your goods or services, including pricing, order fulfillment, cancellations or no shows by you or a customer, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and feedback concerning experiences with your personnel, policies or processes. In performing customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from us. As between you and us, we are solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Cash for Business Account, payment, Card processing, debiting or crediting.<br/><strong><br/>4. Refunds and Returns</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Show your customers your return or cancellation policy when they make their purchase. When you give a refund, it has to include taxes too. You can process a refund up to 120 days from the day you accepted the payment. If you give a refund but don’t have enough funds in your Cash for Business Account, we can recover the difference from you.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">By accepting Card transactions through the Payment Services, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Cash for Business Account in accordance with these Payment Terms and Network Rules.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Network Rules require that you disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return merchandise. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the customer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales. The fees are also refunded by the Company, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your customer. The Company has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.<br/><strong><br/>5. Additional Indemnity</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If you do something using our payment services that leads to us, or our processors, getting sued, fined, or investigated, you agree to cover us.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In addition to the Indemnity Section of the Cash App Terms, you will indemnify, defend, and hold us and our processors (and our respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates and representatives) harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, Tax assessments, penalties, interest, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry, or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises out of or relates to any transaction submitted by you through the Payment Services (including the accuracy of any content or product, service, or transaction information that you provide or any claim or dispute arising out of products or services offered or sold by you).<br/><strong><br/>6. Additional Representations, Warranties, and Covenants</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You agree that all transactions you process through the Company are real sales and don’t break any laws. If your customer has a dispute with the sale, you will work directly with the customer to resolve the dispute.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">In addition to the Limitations of Liability and Damages Section of the Cash App Terms, with each transaction you process through the Payment Services, you represent, warrant and covenant to us that: (a) the transaction represents a bona fide sale; (b) the transaction accurately describes the goods and/or services provided to the customer; (c) you will fulfill all of your obligations to the customer and will resolve any dispute or complaint directly with the customer; (d) you and the transaction comply with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations applicable to you and your business, including any applicable tax, wage and hour, and tip laws and regulations; and (e) except in the ordinary course of business, you are not submitting a transaction that represents a sale to any principal, partner, proprietor, or owner of your entity.</p><h3 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h3__LQpME"><strong>V. Termination of Payment Services</strong></h3><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>1. Termination of Payment Services</strong><br/>We can terminate or refuse your access to the service at any time, for any reason as described in the Modification and Termination Section of the Cash App Terms.<br/><strong><br/>2. Payment Services Upon Closure of Your Cash for Business Account</strong><br/>Unless there’s an ongoing investigation, if your Cash for Business account is closed, we’ll cancel pending transactions and pay out any funds you have left in your account as described in Services Upon Closure of Account Section of the Cash App Terms.<br/><strong><br/>3. Survival</strong></p><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Some terms of our agreement (listed below) will still apply even after our relationship ends.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The following sections will survive termination of these Payment Terms, in addition to those that survive under Effect of Termination Section the Cash App
