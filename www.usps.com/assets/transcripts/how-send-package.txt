31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tip: If you print a shipping label online (with postage included), you don't need a separate address label.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Step 5: Calculate Postage (& Add Insurance or Extra Services)

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Postage is the price you pay to send something plus any extra services you might buy. 

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To see how much you'll need to pay, use the USPS Postage Calculator at postcalc.usps.com (and it helps to have a scale handy).

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To pay for postage, you can:

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Use stamps (you might need a lot).

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Buy and print your postage online using our Click-N-Ship service.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Step 6: Ship Your Package

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
