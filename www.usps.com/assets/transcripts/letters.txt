The United States Postal Service(R) Presents:

How to Mail a Letter or Postcard Anywhere in the U.S.

Step 1: Choose your envelope or postcard

After showing simplified examples of an envelope and postcard, we see a written message being placed and sealed in an envelope.

Step 2: Address the envelope: On the bottom center of the envelope, write the address you want your letter delivered to. Start by writing the recipient's name; on the next line, write their street address; then on the last line, put the city, state, and ZIP Code.

Example delivery address:
Jane Smith
123 Main Street
Anytown, NY 10010

Using the same format, write the return address in the top left corner.

Example return address:
John Doe
456 North Street
Anycity, VA 20020

Step 3: Apply your postage: For standard envelopes weighing 1 oz or less, you can use a Forever(R) stamp. Put the stamp in the top right corner of the front of the envelope (the side where you wrote the address).

For standard-sized postcards, you can use a less expensive postcard stamp. Put the stamp in the provided spot of the postcard--usually the top right corner of the side you're writing your message on.

(Standard-sized postcards are between 5 inches long by 3-1/2 inches high and 6 inches long by 4-1/4 inches high.)

For other sizes, weights, and services (like insurance or certified mail), visit https://postcalc.usps.com and use our Retail Postage Price Calculator tool to determine the cost.

Stamps can be purchased at a variety of locations, including your local Post Office(TM) branch, or online at #
Step 4: Send your letter or postcard: You can leave your outgoing mail in your mailbox (raising the flag if you have one), or drop it in a blue collection box (opening the door on the top front of the box and placing your letter inside), or take it to your local Post Office branch.
