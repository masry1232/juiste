By using our services you agree to these terms on top of any other terms that apply to a specific service you are using (like Additional Cash App Terms of Service, for example). If you use our services on behalf of your company, your company agrees to them too.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">These General Terms of Service (“General Terms”) are a legal agreement between you, as a current or prospective customer of Square’s services (“you,” “your”) and Square, Inc. (”Square,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of Square’s services, including mobile applications, websites, software, and other products and services (collectively, the “Services”). By using any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including our Privacy Notice (see Section 8) and terms that limit our liability (see Section 18) and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see Section 21), which are collectively incorporated herein by reference. You also agree to any additional terms specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), which become part of your agreement with us (collectively, the “Terms”).

During registration we will ask you for information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information. You must provide accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must keep that information current. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your Square Account, including for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted access to the Square Account. We reserve the right to change the account type, suspend or terminate the Square Account of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">2.

The Revised Version will be effective as of the time it is posted, but will not apply retroactively. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You agree to <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_self" href="../../es/en-us/sign.html" rel="">Square’s E-Sign Consent</a>.

Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. Such disclosures and notices are considered received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to our website, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered.

Security</h4><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We take security incredibly seriously, but can’t guarantee that bad actors will not gain access to your personal information. You need to do your part by keeping your passwords safe, being smart about who has access to your account and which of your devices can access our services, and letting us know if you think an unauthorized person is using your account.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">If there is ever a dispute about who owns your account, we are the decider.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental destruction, loss, alteration and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You provide your personal information at your own risk.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">You are solely responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible mobile devices and computer(s). You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or Square Account or any other breach of security. You will immediately take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of a security breach and will cooperate with Square and provide all information requested by Square to remediate the breach. Any assistance provided by Square in relation to a security breach does not in any way operate as acceptance or acknowledgement that Square is in any way responsible or liable to you or any other party in connection with such breach.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">Notwithstanding Sections 20 and 21, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Square Account subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all parties.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">8.

Binding Individual Arbitration</h4><blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">This section provides details about how we will resolve disputes through the arbitration process.</p></blockquote><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>General.</strong><br/>You and Square agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Pre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes.</strong><br/>Before an arbitration is commenced, you or Square agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (“Notice”). Any Notice to Square should be sent by mail to Square, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Scope of Arbitration.<br/></strong>If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association <!-- -->(<a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.adr.org</a>)<!-- --> according to this Section and the <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial Rules.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> for that forum, except you and Square will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA’s Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount. Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong><br/>Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong><br/>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies. Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference. The Arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Square values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim. The Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Arbitration Fees.</strong><br/>In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Opt Out.</strong><br/>You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Dispute. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the “Opt Out”) within thirty (30) days after you create a Square account or we first provide you with the right to reject this provision.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs">The Opt Out must be mailed to Square, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. For your convenience, we are providing an opt out <a class="link_link__21XTk " target="_self" href="../../general/seller-opt-out.html" rel="">notice form</a> you must fill in to Opt Out. You must complete this form by providing your name, address, phone number and the email address(es) you used to sign up and use the Services. This is the only way of opting out of this provision. Opting out will not affect any other aspect of the General Terms, Additional Terms, or the Services, and will have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us.</p><p class="product-page-text_size-1__rn5rs"><strong>Court Proceedings</strong><br/>Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.</p><h4 class="product-page-heading-text_productPageHeading__7H9a7 product-page-heading-text_h4__ZEzVt">22.
